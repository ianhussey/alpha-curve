The significant increase in diversity has made policymakers and social science and medical researchers recognize the enormous disparities that exist in health across racial and ethic populations. In 1998, President Clinton committed the United States to the elimination of health disparities in racial and ethnic minority populations by the year 2010, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has responded by creating the Office for Research on Minority Health. The mission of this office is to identify and support research opportunities to close the gap in the health status of underserved populations, promote the inclusion of minorities in clinical trials, enhance the capacity of the minority community to address health problems, increase collaborative research and research training between minority and majority institutions, and improve the competitiveness and increase the numbers of well-trained minority scientists applying for NIH funding.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This “call to arms” requires a better understanding of the current status as well as the sources of variability in health among minorities. Investigations of the origins of health disparities across ethnic groups have traditionally emphasized environmental hypotheses that concentrate on social and economic inequities related to differential health outcomes. The recent explosion of genetic research clearly shows how genes affect <em>individual</em> variation in many aspects of health and illness (<a href="#c23">Foster, Sharp, &amp; Mulvihill, 2001</a>). The role of genes in the search for the origins of health disparities is receiving increasing attention (<a href="#c47">Sankar et al., 2004</a>). It has been proposed that one key to understanding the origins of differences among traditionally defined racial groups in risk for specific diseases or sensitivity to therapeutic drugs is to explore differences among the groups in respect to relevant genetic factors (e.g., <a href="#c21">Exner, Dries, Domanski, &amp; Cohn, 2001</a>; <a href="#c30">Karter et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#c49">Splawski et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#c51">Taioli et al., 1995</a>). There are also discussions of using DNA-based diagnostic tests and pharmacogenetic screens to make social categories like race and ethnicity largely irrelevant by allowing clinicians to base diagnosis and treatment decisions on the genetic features unique to individual patients (<a href="#c23">Foster et al., 2001</a>)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although scientific evidence implicates numerous variables from both environmental and genetic domains in the causal nexus of racial health disparities, much remains unexplained. The importance of understanding the unexplained pathways of health disparities guarantees an acceleration of research in the future. Perhaps inevitably, research designs on the topic will continue to be structured to provide more evidence on the salience of one or the other of these two broad domains of influence. A major motivation of this article is to emphasize the importance in future research on this topic of avoiding partisanship reminiscent of the intellectually impoverished “nature-nurture” controversy, which would seek causal factors in one domain and deny any possible relevance of the other.</p><a id="amp-60-1-104-ID0EGCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_12" title="Genes and Race">Genes and Race</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Uses and definitions of the term <em>race</em> vary greatly among academic disciplines, policymakers, and the general public. <em>Ethnicity</em> is sometimes used as an alternate term. We consider it important to offer operational distinctions between race and ethnicity because they are terms that characterize people in different ways. Although these definitions do overlap, they involve unique descriptions that provide meaningful differentiations. Ethnicity has been defined in many ways but typically describes membership based on identity, solidarity, and difference felt by members of a group, particularly a national, regional, or racial group. It includes shared traditions that are “historically derived” and a sense of descent. Ethnicity is viewed as involving more group identification that includes individual trajectories of immigration, history, and language. In contrast, race is typically viewed as being based on biological differentiations. The markers for these differences are typically considered genetic in origin.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Here we present a brief genetic perspective on the concept, which will be facilitated if a clear terminological distinction is first made between <em>genetic loci</em> and <em>genetic alleles</em>. Our particular concern is with polymorphic genes—genes that exist in alternative forms called alleles. A locus is a position on a chromosome that can be occupied by an allele of a gene. By virtue of possessing paired chromosomes, one from each parent (except in the case of sex chromosomes in males), each individual has two of each locus. Thus, discussions of genetic differences among individuals refer to their specific configurations of alleles at the loci under examination. With the exception of identical multiple births, each individual human being's genetic configuration (genotype) is unique. The disciplines of quantitative genetics and population genetics are concerned with issues of describing and explaining this enormous genetic diversity among individuals and the extent to which populations may differ in their genetic parameters. Key concepts include the dynamic processes such as mutation, differential fitness, differential reproduction, and migration that affect stability and change in allelic frequencies within and between populations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Original definitions of racial categories suggested three main groups: Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid. The problem with these categorizations has been and continues to be the identification of enough genes responsible for unique relationships within these groups. The results from these attempts often contradict each other, which is an indication of the difficulty in making scientific classifications of race (<a href="#c9">Cavalli-Sforza, 2000</a>). In these terms, the definition of race is a relative matter: “a group of individuals in a species showing closer genetic relationships within the group than to members of other such groups” (<a href="#c27">Hartl &amp; Clark, 1997</a>, p. 121; for a discussion, see Hartl &amp; Clark). A useful metric in this context is that of genetic distance, one variant of which is the probability that a randomly selected allele from one population will be identical to another allele selected from the same population relative to the probability that it will be identical to one selected from a different population (see, e.g., <a href="#c27">Hartl &amp; Clark, 1997</a>). Clearly, a genetic categorization of races is probabilistic. There is no absolute criterion for how great the genetic distance between groups must be in order to justify labeling them distinct races. For different purposes, different criteria may be employed, so that some racial classification schemes consist of many races with small interracial distances, whereas others identify only a few groups with larger intergroup distances.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Race continues to be one of the most politically charged subjects in American life because its associated sociocultural component has often led to categorizations that have been misleading and inappropriately used (<a href="#c32">Kittles &amp; Weiss, 2003</a>). Race also reflects deeply intertwined cultural as well as biological factors, and a careful distinction must be made between race as a statistical risk factor and causal genetic variables (<a href="#c32">Kittles &amp; Weiss, 2003</a>). Thus, genetics cannot provide a single, all-purpose human classification scheme that will be adequate for addressing all of the multifaceted dimensions of health differentials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Differences among populations in allelic frequencies have been described for a large number of genetic loci, among which are many that influence health- or disease-related phenotypes. It is often found, however, that the extent of genetic differences among individuals within populations exceeds that found between groups. As an example, <a href="#c41">Nei's (1975)</a> data showed that of the total genetic variation of Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid racial groups with respect to a group of protein electrophoretic phenotypes, only about 7% could be assigned to differences among the groups; 93% of the variation was within groups (see <a href="#c27">Hartl &amp; Clark, 1997</a>, for a discussion). Such results suggest that designation as a member of a particular socially defined race may provide little predictive value concerning the likelihood of an individual's possessing any particular allele of any particular locus.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Currently there is much interest in common DNA variants known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs involve only a single base pair of the DNA and are frequent, occurring about every 1,000 bases. Some of these DNA differences occur in coding regions and may thus alter the protein coded by the gene. SNPs are also found outside of coding regions, and some of these may have functional consequences, such as altering regulation of gene expression. A rapidly expanding literature has described the association of SNPs with a wide variety of disease states.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There is some literature that suggests that use of SNPs will contribute to an understanding of differences across racial/ethnic groups. For example, in the study of hypertension, the same SNPs have been found to have different allelic frequencies in one population compared with another (African Americans and Caucasians) in those that have a disease compared with those who do not (e.g., <a href="#c12">Cui et al., 2003</a>; <a href="#c20">Erlich et al., 2003</a>). These findings suggest that there are alterations in DNA that vary by ethnic groups and that might be related to the excess disease observed in some minority groups. Although these results provide interesting and exciting possibilities, caution is warranted for at least two reasons. First, some of the differences found might be an artifact of differences in databases. For example, <a href="#c16">Dvornyk et al. (2004)</a> conducted a comparative analysis of the SNP data of candidate genes and some retrieved from the public domain databases. Their work suggests that the databases may have serious limitations for studying complex disorders with an ethnic-dependent background because of the incomplete and uneven representation of the allelic frequencies for these major ethnic groups. In addition, among various populations there are also growing examples of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions related to health outcomes (<a href="#c33">J. E. Lee et al., 2004</a>). Gene-environment interactions provide perhaps the most reasonable and comprehensive way to consider the impact SNPs have on disease.</p><a id="amp-60-1-104-ID0EFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_22" title="What Do Genes Really Do, Anyway?">What Do Genes Really Do, Anyway?</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The recent description of the genomes of human beings and of a number of animal species has been a stunning achievement of molecular biology. It is increasingly clear, however, that knowledge of the sequence of the genome alone is insufficient for deep understanding of such complex biological systems as those of health and disease. However, the research tools, concepts, methods, theories, and data generated in the enterprise provide researchers with unprecedented new opportunities for major advances in synergy with established (but by no means outmoded) methods and theories. In the remainder of this article, we provide a glimpse of such an integrated perspective.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The genetic information at a locus is coded in DNA. Through the processes of transcription into RNA and subsequent translation, the primary gene product—a protein—is produced. Different alleles of a particular locus are different in the sequence of the base pairs of the DNA, which may result in different configurations of the protein, which can have dramatic consequences for the phenotype influenced by the locus. Although the mechanism whereby a difference in genotype results in a major difference in phenotype may be unknown in specific cases, the broad, general principles of the mechanisms of gene action are now well known. The proteins affect the structure and function of the organism, and their consequences are the subject matter of all of organismic biology. So the domains of knowledge currently identified as anatomy, biochemistry, endocrinology, immunology, physiology, and so forth, can all be considered to be characterizing aspects of the complex network through which genetic effects are expressed. Furthermore, the same network mediates the influence of environmental agencies. In this context the environment is defined by exclusion as being all effective elements in the system that are not derived from DNA. This comprehensive conception thus embraces influences from the physical to the sociocultural realms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a general schema, the causal nexus for any particular phenotype may be viewed as a complex network with inputs from multiple genetic loci and from multiple environmental factors. The network is characterized by parallel and redundant pathways with feedback loops that may provide for compensatory mechanisms, in which one pathway adjusts for inadequacies in another pathway. The dynamics of these complex causal nexuses are frequently manifested as interactions of genes with genes, genes with environments, or environments with environments. There are examples in the current literature of environmental-gene interactions producing diseases such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, type 2 diabetes, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis (<a href="#c4">Booth &amp; Vyas, 2001</a>; <a href="#c11">Cooper, Miller, &amp; Pandey, 1999</a>; <a href="#c54">Wareham, Franks, &amp; Harding, 2002</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another one of the interesting gene-environment interactions comes from the work examining the various forms of the ApoE gene. <a href="#c36">Mayeux et al. (1995)</a> found that traumatic head injury is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease if an individual has a genotype that consists of at least one ApoE ε4 allele. In contrast, work by <a href="#c61">Yaffe, Haan, Byers, Tangen, and Kuller (2000)</a> provided suggestive evidence on the protective effects of environmental interventions in conjunction with particular ApoE genotypes. They found that administration of estrogen is an effective preventative step against cognitive decline in women without dementia who are 65 years of age and older, but only if they possess the ApoE ε2 and ε3 alleles.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a consequence of variability in genotype and also in the diversity of environmental factors encountered, the causal field of genetic and environmental factors necessarily varies greatly across individuals (<a href="#c46">Sahota et al., 1997</a>). Because of the gene-gene and gene-environment contextual considerations, a particular genetic input or particular environmental input may have quite different consequences in different individuals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of course, some genetic and some environmental variables may be sufficiently potent that their influence is apparent in all or most circumstances. A gene of this sort may be described as a “major” gene and represents the limiting case of the polygenic schema just given, where the number of contributing loci is one. Major genes are implicated in many disease states (recall that to say that a gene is a gene for the disease is to say that it is a locus at which the effect of allelic substitution is associated with a particular disease state). Even the effects of such apparent major single genes, however, may be found to be modifiable by genetic or environmental context, resulting (in the case of “disease genes”) in different ages of onset, varying severity, different temporal course, diverse symptom patterns, and dissimilar susceptibility to medical treatment or to preventive interventions. It should also be noted that whereas a gene might be reasonably regarded as “the” gene for a condition, it is not necessarily “the only” gene for the condition. Allelic configurations of other loci might be associated with a similar symptom pattern.</p><a id="amp-60-1-104-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_31" title="Quantitative Genetics">Quantitative Genetics</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When a quantitative genetic approach is used, origins of individual differences are conceptualized to derive from genetic and environmental sources of variance and thus, in theory, account for the total behavioral or phenotypic variation (phenotypic variation refers to the distribution of scores that result from studying the behavior of interest; for a discussion, see <a href="#c44">Plomin, DeFries, McClearn, &amp; Rutter, 1997</a>). In some disease processes such as phenylketonuria or Huntington's chorea, major genes have been found to be associated with the formation of the disease states. These examples of one gene-one disease scenarios are typically not the case for most behavioral phenomena nor are they the premise of quantitative genetic analyses. The underlying premise is that multiple genes are involved in genetic effects that are observed in a trait.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the label <em>quantitative genetics</em> implies an emphasis on heritable aspects of behavior, the identification of environmental influences on a phenotype is equally important in this type of analysis. Environmental effects are partitioned into those that are common (shared) or unique (nonshared) (see <a href="#c44">Plomin et al., 1997</a>). Common/shared environmental variation is the phenotypic variation attributed to the subjects' living in the same family, sharing the same neighborhood, and so forth, and thus sharing the same environment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Unique/nonshared environmental variation is the component of phenotypic variance that can be attributed to the environmental factors not shared by family members and thus making members of the same family different from one another. One hypothesis posed about the outcome of such studies on older populations is that as people age, unique environmental factors will have a greater impact on the etiology of behavioral traits. This idea is one derived from the speculation that as a person ages, he or she has a greater number of experiences that help to shape the behavioral trait of interest. It is of course hazardous to operate on speculation and conjecture rather than scientific data, and there is evidence that this scenario is not the case with several phenotypes in older individuals, such as cognitive abilities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Quantitative genetic designs frequently take the form of twin studies. The classic twin study involves comparisons between genetically identical or monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex fraternal or dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (twin pairs that are genetically as alike as siblings but are born at the same time). The basic model derives from the well-substantiated assumption that MZ twin pairs share 100% of their genes and that DZ twin pairs share on average 50% of the genes segregating in their family. Using data from twin pairs and operating under this assumption, researchers consider heritability to be the proportion of phenotypic variance that is due to genetic variation. Several techniques can be used to analyze the heritability of a trait, but a popular preliminary method for calculating heritability is to calculate twice the difference between the intraclass correlations (the statistical calculation of how similar one twin is to the other) of MZ and DZ twin pairs. Shared environmental variance can be calculated by doubling the intraclass correlation for the DZ twin pairs and subtracting the MZ intraclass correlation. By subtracting the sum of the heritability and shared environmental estimates from 1.00, an estimate of nonshared environmental variance is obtained.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The preferred method of analyzing data in the field of behavioral genetics, as in other social science fields, is structural equation modeling (SEM) or biometrical modeling, the fitting of observed data to models of genetic and environmental effects (for an overview, see <a href="#c40">Neale &amp; Cardon, 1992</a>). These SEM techniques provide estimates that represent the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences. Variances and covariances are used in the calculation of the components of variance (genetic, shared environmental, and unique environmental). The benefit of these techniques over the intraclass correlation method described earlier is that multivariate extensions can be performed to assess simultaneously shared and unique genetic and environmental relationships among two or more variables.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An example of a path diagram of a classic univariate twin model is shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. Path diagrams are useful in that they provide a visual display of correlational and causal relationships between variables. When path analysis is used, specific hypotheses about relationships between the variables are quantified by parameter estimates or path coefficients. In the ACE Model shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, the overall phenotypic variance is explained using three components: A (additive genetic variation), C (common or shared family environmental variation), and E (unique environmental variation). In <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, A, C, and E are latent (unmeasured or unobserved) variables, and <em>h</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>e</em> are parameter estimates. Proportions of variance for each component are calculated by squaring the parameter estimates.

When these techniques are used, parameters are dropped from the model to determine if a more parsimonious model (one with fewer parameters or latent variables yet still fitting the data) is available to account for the data. Statistical significance of these parameters is assessed from maximum likelihood ratio chi-square comparisons of the models after the parameters have been dropped. Significance of parameters is evaluated by taking the difference between the chi-squares of the full and reduced model and using that difference as a chi-square. The degrees of freedom are calculated by taking the difference between the degrees of freedom for the full and reduced models. If there is a significant difference between two models, the parameter that was dropped is significant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Using this basic model, then, one can see that if MZ twins are more alike than DZ twins, phenotypic variance can be attributed, in part, to genetic sources. If the genetic variation estimated by the parameter <em>h</em> represents a significant source of variation, this parameter cannot be dropped from the model without causing a significant change in chi-square between the models. Squaring that parameter <em>h</em> provides an estimate of heritability. The contributions of shared and unique environmental factors to the phenotypic variation are also tested in this manner. For ease of comprehension, parameter estimates are typically standardized.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Adding to the complexity is temporal change in the causal network. Different genes are expressed at different ages, and different environmental factors are encountered at different stages of life.

With many loci of small individual effect sizes, the allelic frequency approach to characterizing genetic distance may be unfeasible, and differences in the estimated quantitative genetic parameters may be a principal evidential base. As previously described, heritability is one of the statistics that results from these analyses. It must immediately be obvious that heritability is a descriptive statistic, based on circumstances of a particular population at a particular time. The denominator includes both genetic and environmental variance, so the index is subject to variation as effective environmental changes take place. Further, heritability can differ over age within a population. For example, a rather widely held hypothesis from life span developmental theory suggests that over a lifetime, accumulated environmental effects will lead to a decline in heritability and to an increased influence of nonshared environmental sources. This outcome, supporting a “slings and arrows” interpretation, is in fact found in respect to many phenotypes, but not all (e.g., see <a href="#c37">McClearn et al., 1997</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">That heritability should be the standard index is largely a historical accident, and the corresponding index of “environmentality” is equally informative. Regrettably, surplus meaning has been attached in the past to the heritability label, and misinterpretations have arisen. For example, a finding of lower heritability for a desirable phenotype or higher heritability for undesirable characteristics in a minority group relative to their majority group counterparts may have been interpreted as demonstrating a “superior” set of genes. It is clear that heritability (or environmentality) can differ between groups for various reasons: differences in the main effect of environment, differences in the interaction of environment with genotype, differences in gene expression arising from exposure to particular environments, and differences in allelic frequencies. It should also be obvious that no special virtue attaches to groups with higher or lower values of heritability (e.g., other things being equal, the group with the higher heritability might have either a higher frequency of “undesirable” alleles or of “desirable” alleles).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Just as considerations of allelic frequency differences enter into investigations of health disparities, differences in the range of environmental exposures must also be considered. For example, the environmental force of discriminatory practices in schooling, health care, and employment opportunities throughout life may have pervasive impact on health phenotypes of African Americans and other minorities (<a href="#c58">Whitfield, Weidner, Clark, &amp; Anderson, 2002</a>). If environmental variance cannot be shown or assumed to be equal in two populations being examined, comparisons of heritability indices must be interpreted with great care.</p><a id="amp-60-1-104-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_50" title="Modeling Racial or Ethnic Influences">Modeling Racial or Ethnic Influences</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There are no existing quantitative genetic models that incorporate racial or ethnic differences, but Eaves and others have developed models of “cultural transmission.” These models use data from parents and offspring to account for the nongenetic transfer of information from parent to offspring (<a href="#c17">Eaves, 1976</a>; <a href="#c18">Eaves, Fulker, &amp; Heath, 1989</a>). This approach proposes that cultural inheritance may act on genetic and environmental differences between individuals (<a href="#c17">Eaves, 1976</a>). Although there are numerous ways one could consider extending models of genetic and environmental influence to ascertain cultural factors, four straightforward conceptual and explanatory approaches have been offered (<a href="#c55">Whitfield, Brandon, &amp; Wiggins, 2003</a>) that attempt to explain how the influence of race and ethnicity is accounted for within the latent factors in the classic twin model: <br /><ol type="1"><li>Race and ethnicity are encompassed in the shared environmental component of the traditional ACE model.</li><li>Race and ethnicity influences are distributed in the shared and nonshared environmental components of the model.</li><li>Race and ethnicity represent an additional component that is not modeled in the traditional ACE model represented in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.</li><li>Race and ethnicity can be assessed by testing constraints of a multigroup model that tests equality or invariance across groups of identical and fraternal twins from at least two cultural groups (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).<a name="fig2" /></li></ol><br /><br /><a id="fig2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/74bb55ce7690b0ccbe3922318724daa8/571c005a/pdh/amp/amp-60-1-104-fig2a.gif" alt="amp-60-1-104-fig2a.gif" title="Figure 2.

Furthermore, this variance is not specific to the individuals, as is the case of the nonshared environmental component, but impacts both twins. This component would represent the behavioral norms and structural social constraints that can interact to systematically alter the meaning of different factors in behavioral processes. For example, <a href="#c15">Dressler (1985)</a> studied how active coping styles moderated the effects of stressors differently for men and women. For women, active coping buffered the effects of stressors, but for men, active coping exacerbated the effects. These results are consistent with the social context of the community and with behavioral norms governing gender roles within the community. The behavioral norms would not necessarily impact twins to the same degree such that these effects could be considered shared environmental effects (the assumption in the twin model is a correlation of 1.00 for shared environmental influences). In the ACE model, those influences could be estimated rather than be considered error and embodied in the nonshared environmental component.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The fourth model would be similar to performing a test of homogeneity of variance. It might be useful, in performing such a comparison, first to perform a test of homogeneity of variance between the groups at the phenotypic level and then to conduct the model fitting to examine potential invariance across the components. Several levels of invariance could be tested: configural, metric, strong factorial, and strict factorial (<a href="#c39">Meredith, 1993</a>). Obtaining configural invariance—the same pattern of factor loadings but not strictly equivalent factor loadings across groups—provides evidence that <em>qualitative</em> similarity exists across the groups being compared. If the factor loadings in one group are proportionally equivalent to corresponding loadings in the other group, metric invariance is attained, and factors can be unambiguously compared across groups. Strong factorial and strict factorial invariance are conditions in which the mean intercepts and unique variances are found to be equivalent across the groups, respectively. Strict factorial invariance is necessary for comparisons of factor-level means.</p><a id="amp-60-1-104-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_56" title="Some Research Examples">Some Research Examples</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There is significant potential for understanding health and health disparities using quantitative genetic methods, but there are also limitations and biases that are particularly important in cross-ethnic extensions of previous work. Indeed, one manifestation of health disparities has a particular methodological implication for twin studies. In quantitative genetic/twin designs, one of the primary potential selection biases in research of adults involves the requirement that intact pairs are necessary to conduct these analyses. To perform quantitative genetic analyses in the traditional manner, researchers must include data from both members of a twin pair. If mortality occurs for one member of the pair, the pair is eliminated from inclusion in the research study (<a href="#c48">Simmons et al., 1997</a>). Given the decreased probability that two individuals will live into late life because of increased risk for mortality from disease or accidents, these twin pairs could be considered successful agers (<a href="#c45">Rowe &amp; Kahn, 1997</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As cited in <a href="#c48">Simmons et al. (1997)</a>, twin samples may be biased toward healthier individuals because of higher refusal rates when one or both are ailing and the removal of the most frail due to the mortality of one twin. There are well-documented differences in mortality across ethnic groups that may be important in the extension of quantitative genetic studies of aging among ethnic minority groups. African Americans, for example, experience significantly higher mortality rates than Caucasians; the age- and gender-adjusted death rate from all causes is 60% higher in African Americans than in Caucasians (<a href="#c52">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [U.S. DHHS], 1995</a>). This differential produces a life expectancy gap between African Americans and Caucasians of 8.2 years for men and 5.9 years for women (<a href="#c52">U.S. DHHS, 1995</a>). These findings suggest the probability of recruiting intact African American twin pairs in late life may be less than that for Caucasians. In addition, do population mortality rates create differences between intact twin pairs and members of nonintact pairs in psychological, social, or health dimensions of adulthood and later life for African Americans? Using quantitative genetic methods (e.g., twin studies) to address this question can provide valuable insight about successful aging for African Americans.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A recent twin study, the Carolina African American Twin Study of Aging (CAATSA; <a href="#c56">Whitfield, Brandon, Wiggins, Vogler, &amp; McClearn, 2003</a>), was designed to examine the proportion of genetic and environmental influences on health in a sample of adult African American twins between 25 and 89 years of age. Analysis of data from the CAATSA suggests that differences in blood pressure among this ethnic group influence the intact status of older twins. When demographic variables were controlled, only hemodynamic measures differed between members of intact twin pairs and surviving members of nonintact twin pairs (<a href="#c56">Whitfield et al., 2003</a>). Thus, it appears that using only pairs in research on older African American twins may represent a bias in estimating the origins of individual variability in some examinations of health.</p><a id="amp-60-1-104-ID0EBBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Blood Pressure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One of the most common health disparities experienced by African Americans as a group is hypertension.

A review by <a href="#c25">Harrap (1994)</a> showed that previous studies have found that genetic factors account for 30% to 60% of the variance in blood pressure. When preliminary data from the CAATSA were used (<a href="#c6">Brandon et al., 2003</a>), a large proportion of the individual variability in blood pressure for African American adults was found to arise from genetic sources. Heritabilities for this sample of African American twins were.44 and.52 for DBP and SBP, respectively, whereas environmental influences accounted for.56 and.48, respectively, after controlling for the effects of antihypertensive medication. These heritability and environmental estimates are similar to those of previous studies that have used the “classic twin” design. These findings suggest that although genes do impact blood pressure, environmental factors play a larger role in determining differences in blood pressure, particularly as people grow older.</p><a id="amp-60-1-104-ID0EABCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Forced Expiratory Volume</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Previous research has shown that forced expiratory volume (FEV) is a useful predictor of remaining life in older adults (e.g., <a href="#c7">Burrows, 1990</a>; <a href="#c50">Tager, Segal, Speizer, &amp; Weiss, 1988</a>). Epidemiological studies have investigated the decline of FEV as an indicator of chronic airways obstructive disease (e.g., <a href="#c8">Burrows, Bloom, Traver, &amp; Cline, 1987</a>), and of the presence and course of asthma (<a href="#c19">Enright, Lebowitz, &amp; Cockroft, 1994</a>), and as a measure of the effects of air pollution (<a href="#c14">Dockery et al., 1985</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although there is considerable interindividual variability in level and rate of change in FEV, very few studies have assessed the sources of this variability. In one analysis (<a href="#c38">McClearn, Svartengren, Pedersen, Heller, &amp; Plomin, 1994</a>) of the influence of genetic and environmental factors on FEV in Swedish twins, a substantial influence of genetic factors on FEV in middle and late adulthood was found. Fifty-seven percent of the individual variation was due to genetic factors, and the remainder of the variance was due to nonshared environmental factors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A study of Russian adult twins (<a href="#c57">Whitfield, Grant, Ravich-Scherbo, Marutina, &amp; Ibatoullina, 1999</a>) attempted to compare results from an earlier study (<a href="#c38">McClearn et al., 1994</a>) of Swedish twins. After the effects of age, gender, height, and smoking were partialed out of FEV, quantitative genetic analyses were conducted. Shared environmental effects were significant, accounting for 47% of the variance in FEV, whereas genetic effects accounted for only 28% of the variance. The proportion of variance on FEV that was attributable to genetic factors was greater (57%) for the Swedish than for the Russian sample (28%). In addition, shared environmental influences were not important in the Swedish sample but accounted for nearly half of the variance in the Russian sample. There could be allelic differences between the populations, but there are also differences in the environments between these countries. Hypotheses about how the contextual and situational factors influence the genetic and environmental estimates between these two samples could take at least two forms: (a) Recent sociopolitical changes have made Russian DZ twins more alike than Swedish DZ twins or (b) long-standing cultural influences make Russian DZ twins more alike than Swedish DZ twins.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Data from the CAATSA were used to calculate the genetic and environmental estimates for FEV among African Americans (<a href="#c59">Whitfield, Wiggins, Belue, &amp; Brandon, 2004</a>); 30% was attributable to genetic influences, 10% to shared environmental influences, and 60% to nonshared environmental forces. What do these differences in estimates mean? The estimates for any phenotype are constrained by the larger cultural influences that exist for the sample under study but suggest that there are critical cultural factors that contribute to individual variability in FEV. In addition, comparisons of within-group age variability and differences in raw variances between groups might be dimensions of future studies of these populations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings also demonstrate that sources of individual differences may not be static across cultures and that further investigation of the environmental mediation of estimates of genetic and environmental influences is warranted. It also supports the notion that investigations of health differentials across ethnic groups solely on the basis of genetic differences will not yield accurate identification of the mechanisms responsible for health disparities. Instead, describing health differentials as arising from insults to a complex system represented by the interaction between genes and environments that creates an excess burden of chronic illness and disease within some groups is a more accurate perspective.</p><a id="amp-60-1-104-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_74" title="Genetics, Environment, and Health: Integration of Approaches">Genetics, Environment, and Health: Integration of Approaches</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To this point, we have attempted to make the argument that investigations of health differentials across ethnic groups solely on the basis of genetic differences or environmental factors will not yield comprehensive identification of the mechanisms responsible for health disparities. Furthermore, preconceived notions about genetically based racial inferiority have hindered advances in understanding and reducing health disparities. There is trepidation by some social scientists and behavioral medicine researchers about the use of genetic approaches in the study of health (<a href="#c55">Whitfield, Brandon, &amp; Wiggins, 2003</a>). The apprehension may arise from previous research that used poorly or inappropriately defined phenotypes to make generalizations about group differences (<a href="#c5">Bowman, 1991</a>; <a href="#c24">Gamble, 1993</a>; <a href="#c31">King, 1992</a>). Attempts relying solely on genetic explanations to explain the differential health burden experienced by ethnic minorities is illogical given that there may be considerably smaller genetic differences across racial groups than within each group with respect to any particular disease or health-related phenotype. Overemphasis on genetics as the single major explanatory factor in health disparities could lead researchers to overlook factors that contribute to disparities in more substantial ways and may also reinforce the kind of racial stereotyping that contributed to disparities in the first place (<a href="#c47">Sankar et al., 2004</a>). The role of genetic influences, however, cannot be completely dismissed. Population differences can and do exist with respect to major disease-related loci (not only between majority and minority populations but also between majority groups of different European origin).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Complementary, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to utilize information that has been provided from the Human Genome Project so that informative explorations of the underlying causes of health and illness and the related psychosocial behaviors can be performed. The utility of the increasingly sophisticated statistical designs of structural equation models in quantitative genetics can be enormously amplified by incorporating measurements of theoretically relevant environmental variables, specific genetic loci, and the physiological mediators of the causal nexus. Such programs of research will clearly require the expertise of teams of scholars and the deployment of considerable resources. Outcomes of this interdisciplinary work will not only address the issue of health disparities but will provide the knowledge base of relevance to the health of all human beings, considered as individuals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Briefly stated, a basic question is whether knowledge of racial identity in any way adds significantly to the information required in the processes of diagnosis, remediation, therapeutics, and prevention. Undoubtedly, the answer will vary for different health issues. When presenting symptoms may have a different probable etiology depending on racial or ethnic grouping (e.g., sickle cell anemia) or various therapies may have differential efficacy (e.g., calcium channel blockers for hypertension), group membership may have some salience. This salience may derive from genes that differ in frequency between groups and from environmental factors that differ between the groups. But the crux of the matter is the individual, with her or his unique genetic constitution and history of environmental influences. As understanding of the dynamics of the interplay between genes and environment in disease and health increases, we shall move toward effective individual medicine, and racial or ethnic group origins will increasingly become less relevant.</p><a id="amp-60-1-104-ID0E04B0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_80" title="REFERENCES">REFERENCES</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Alderman, M.
