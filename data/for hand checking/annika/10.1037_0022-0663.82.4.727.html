The present study examines this latter issue and focuses on the ways in which knowledge of a text schema can facilitate comprehension of a problem-solution text.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The notion of schema, first introduced by <a href="#c2">Bartlett (1932)</a>, was incorporated as a central feature in text analysis by <a href="#c16">Rumelhart and Ortony (1977)</a> and developed by <a href="#c10">Mandler and Johnson (1977)</a> in their work on text grammars. A text schema is a network which characterizes a category of texts; it describes the components that appear systematically in all texts in this category, and it is made up of nodes and links.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Extensive attention has been paid to narrative schemata, but a growing body of work has been devoted to descriptions of problem-solution texts. In particular, studies have dealt with their specific rhetorical devices (<a href="#c6">Horowitz, 1987</a>) and the way this type of text is organized (<a href="#c7">Jordan, 1980</a>; <a href="#c19">Van Dijk, 1980</a>; <a href="#c11">Meyer, 1974</a>, <a href="#c12">1984</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Problem-solution texts are considered to contain at least five topics: (a) presentation of the problem; (b) a statement presenting a solution; (c) presentation of data supporting this solution; (d) critical analysis, and (e) conclusion. It is generally assumed that children gradually internalize the typical network of text categories through repeated exposure in the form of listening and reading. Most studies have focused on how children internalize narrative texts. The progression toward an “ideal” story schema (<a href="#c3">Freedman, 1987</a>) in school children’s written production indicates that rate of development is dependent on whether stories are true or invented. Patterns of development are complex and can not be represented by a steady curve upward; rather, they are dependent upon the emergence of processes governing text comprehension.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The major function of text schemas is to guide comprehension and to govern information retrieval when readers are required to recall or summarize a text. The greatest amount of experimental work on these functions has been on narrative texts. People recall stories through schemas (<a href="#c5">Glenn, 1978</a>). In reconstruction and recall tasks, both good and poor readers implement story schemas when the story follows the canonical format. However, poor readers’ story schema are “either not as well developed or as efficiently used as the good readers<sup>1</sup>
” (<a href="#c14">Rahman &amp; Bisanz, 1986</a>, p. 324). Prompting poor readers to use a story schema does not improve recall. In other words, good readers construct good representations of text meaning; similarly, a representation is good if it reflects the text schema. The main issue is whether the text schema reflected in recall purely results from a (passive) “tape-recorder” form of storage of information or whether storage and retrieval of the text are facilitated by the activation of a previously acquired text schema.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Data from recall tasks dealing with fairly easy texts are not informative as to how schemas intervene in reading comprehension. Data obtained on comprehension tests are equally problematic. Comprehension is facilitated if the text fits a schema (<a href="#c8">Kintsch &amp; Yarbrough, 1982</a>) and familiarity with the schema improves text comprehension (<a href="#c17">Rowe &amp; Rayford, 1987</a>; <a href="#c9">Lorch, Bellack, &amp; Augsbach, 1987</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The real issue is not so much to show that schema knowledge facilitates comprehension, but rather to describe how this takes place and to define its function in the construction of the macrostructure (reflecting the general architecture of the text topics). <a href="#c20">Van Dijk &amp; Kintsch (1983)</a> argue that the macrostructure is formed by the implementation of macrooperations which mainly consist of selecting, constructing, and generalizing. These operations result in the construction of the macropropositions forming the macrostructure. Activation of a schema guides the construction of the macrostructure by targeting the units to be selected and providing the hierarchical structure which acts as the foundation for the macrostructure. Thus schemas should enable readers to identify the important information in the text.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present experiment was designed to test this hypothesis. When subjects use schema information during reading, facilitation may be partial or total. When the operation of assigning semantic content to schema nodes is elementary, facilitation should be total. When more complex operations are called for to identify the propositions corresponding to nodes, facilitation is likely to be partial. Alternatively, if subjects construct the macrostructure without activation of a schema, aids should have no effect on (i.e., should not improve) text comprehension.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present study, the impact of schema aids during the reading process was analyzed in a situation where comprehension called for considerable effort, since the material used was problem-solution text. In terms of design, the problem was to develop a schema that was general enough to be representative of this text category, and sufficiently specific to be useful. The major criticism addressed to proponents of text grammars centers on the representativeness of schemas (<a href="#c1">Adam, 1987</a>). To respond to this criticism, <a href="#c4">Frederiksen (1986)</a> introduced the notion of “problem frame”. In a frame, the order and links between nodes can vary from text to text. A frame is not a rigidly defined structure but rather contains stable headings (nodes) that occur in all problem-solution texts. The assumption is that individuals have a list of nodes stored in memory and construct an appropriate frame for each text. The outcome of the introduction of the notion of frame is that the schema model loses in explanatory power but gains in representativeness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The psychological validity of this descriptive notion has not been tested and hence little is known about the role of the frame in problem-solution text comprehension.

Subjects were selected at random from four classes in four schools which catered to comparable socioeconomic backgrounds. Most families were middle class. The students ranged in ages from 9.6 years to 10.2 years old with a mean age of 10 years and 1 month.</p><a id="edu-82-4-727-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Materials</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two extracts from (French) 5th-grade school textbooks were selected. The first, entitled “The Invention of the Printing Press,” (<a href="#c13">Obadia et al., 1982</a>) was made up of 208 words, 22 lines, 10 sentences, 126 propositions (<a href="#c18">Turner &amp; Green, 1978</a>) and 5 paragraphs covering: (a) the presentation of the problem “how to print,” (b) the description of the principles of the printing press; (c) explanations of the procedure; (d) the history of printing; and (e) the impact of the invention of the printing press. This text was used for practice and as a pretest for matching subjects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The second text, used as the posttest, was entitled “How to Measure the Distance Between Stars” (<a href="#c15">Reeves, 1985</a>). It was made up of 237 words, 25 lines, 14 sentences and 142 propositions. The text was divided into five paragraphs. The first paragraph presented the problem. The frame node was “problem” and the sentence underlined (macrostructure) was “how does one measure the distances between stars?” The second paragraph presented the first solution. The frame node was “first solution” and the sentence underlined was “the amount of light given off by the star must have been known.” For the third paragraph, the frame-node was “second solution” and the sentence underlined was “the color of the light must have been known.” For the fourth paragraph, the frame node was “third solution” and the sentence underlined was “variations in luminosity must have been known.” For the fifth paragraph, the frame node was “fourth solution” and the sentence underlined was “when certains stars explode, we learn something.” The four last paragraphs were constructed in the same way: criticism of the solution presented in the previous paragraph, and presentation of a new solution. The last sentence of each paragraph contained the macrostructure. Both texts were typed on sheets of paper.</p><a id="edu-82-4-727-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Design and Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The subjects read the text, wrote a summary, and took the comprehension test. Subjects were not allowed to reread or change their summaries after starting to answer the comprehension test. They were informed that each test was scored on the basis of 20 points. Subjects were tested individually in a quiet room in their school by the same examiner. Subjects were alloted 25 min, but all completed the task in less time. Subjects were allowed to have the text in front of them during the entire experiment and could consult it freely when writing the summary and answering questions. This procedure was designed to reduce memory effects and to be ecologically closer to classwork.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The experiment was divided into two phases (pretest and posttest) administered at a 2-week interval in the same school on Mondays and Tuesdays. The purpose of the pretest was to evaluate the level of each subject for text comprehension and summary writing. All the subjects read the text entitled “The Invention of the Printing Press,” wrote the summary, and answered the questions. The comprehension test scores and the summary were used to match subjects who were then assigned to one of the five conditions. Five homogeneous groups (of 20 subjects each) were formed on the bases of gender, age, and scores on the pretest.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The posttest was identical to the pretest except that the text used was “How to Measure the Distance between Stars” and the text aids provided to the subjects varied across conditions. Five conditions were tested: (a) the <em>control group</em> read texts with no annotation; (b) the <em>macro group</em> read texts with macrostructure sentences underlines; (c) the <em>frame-heading group</em> read texts where the frame (problem, first solution, etc.) were presented between the title and the beginning of the body of the text—in other words, subjects were given the text structure before they read the text, so their task thus consisted of determining the relationship between the paragraphs and the frame headings; (d) the <em>frame-margin group</em> read texts where the frame headings appeared in the margins facing each paragraph, a condition identical to the previous one except that subjects encountered the frame as they read the text; and (e) the macro and frame-margin group read texts with frame information identical to Group 4, plus macrostructure underlined as in Group 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A five-item comprehension test on macrostructure constituents was devised for each text. The first question dealt with text topic (first paragraph, e.g., “what is the text about?”). The second item dealt with the second paragraph. On the pretest subjects were asked to describe methods of printing (paragraph 2), to name the piece of equipment necessary for printing (paragraph 3), to describe methods of printing before the invention of the printing press (paragraph 4), and to state the advantages of the printing press (paragraph 5).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On the second text subjects were asked to explain why certain stars seem to be brighter than others (paragraph 2), to describe how to measure the distance between the Earth and the stars (paragraph 3), to state what the color of a star means (paragraph 4) and to explain what information we can get when a star suddenly explodes (paragraph 5). Subjects were asked to respond in writing in the space provided below each question.

Hypotheses as to the role of the frame and the macrostructure were tested by comparing control group scores with those of the four experimental groups. Orthogonal, single-degree-of-freedom contrasts reveal that control group performance was significantly lower than the other groups for both the comprehension test, 
<em>F</em>(1, 95) = 5.19, <em>p</em> &lt; .01, <em>MS</em>e = 102.2, and the summary, 
<em>F</em>(1, 95) = 4.96, <em>p</em> &lt; .01, <em>MS</em>e = 92.14. Thus, all aids significantly improved performance on the comprehension test and on the summary.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the four experimental groups (macro, frame-heading, frame-margin and macro and frame-margin) for scores on either the comprehension test or the summary. In other words, underlining of the macrostructure was as efficient as providing information on the frame. When the problem frame appeared in the margin, performances were no better than when the problem frame was presented at the start of the text.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Performance within each of the five groups on the comprehension test and the summary tasks was comparable and the effects were in the same direction. The Pearson Product Moment correlation for comprehension test and summary scores was <em>r</em>(100) = .35 (<em>p</em> &lt; .001). This low correlation (.35) suggests that aids may have had a differential effect as a function of the task (comprehension test vs. summary) and reader strategy. The lack of significant differences between effects of frame information versus information provided by underlining of the macrostructure runs against predictions. One likely explanation is that the underlined macrostructure information was used directly to answer questions or to write the summary. In contrast, a frame provides an outline of the text that is too general for readers to apply as such. Knowing that the first paragraph is devoted to presenting the problem cannot directly help the subject answer comprehension questions or write a summary. However, the general structure of the text furnished by the frame can enable readers to construct a hierarchy and select relevant pieces of information. Thus knowledge of text structure can facilitate implementation of the operations underlying comprehension. This suggests that the relative efficiency of each type of aid varies as a function of the type of comprehension strategy implemented by the reader. Reader strategy may interact with frame and macrostructure aids, and so frame information may be useful to readers who are not able to construct an appropriate frame, or readers who have poorly defined text processing strategies and are ready to use any type of aid available. Frame information may be inefficient either because subjects use a strategy that differs from the one described by <a href="#c20">van Dijk &amp; Kintsch (1983)</a> (i.e., a strategy that does not require frame construction) or because these readers already have full mastery of the operations described by <a href="#c20">van Dijk and Kintsch (1983)</a>. In the latter case the frame is redundant and it will be relatively inefficient for the construction of the macrostructure. In other words, comprehension aids can either help, hinder, or be of no use to readers as a function of level of reading skill and type of strategy implemented.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The pretest scores provided information on the relative efficiency of reader strategies. Readers who scores low on the pretest were assumed to not have mastered adequate processing techniques, in contrast to high scorers who were assumed to have used efficient strategies. The relative stability of reader strategies is confirmed by the Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients between pretest and posttest performances of subjects composing the control group, <em>r</em>(20) = .72, <em>p</em> &lt; .001 for the comprehension test and <em>r</em>(20) = .73, <em>p</em> &lt; .001 for the summary. Thus the pretest scores could differentiate between good and poor comprehenders and good and poor summarizers. Subjects scoring &gt; 11.5 on the comprehension pretest were classified as good comprehenders, or as poor comprehenders if they scored &lt; 10. Subjects who obtained the median on the pretest were not included in the posttest since their strategies were the least contrasted and the least stable. Summary scores were handled in the same way: Good summarizers were defined as those subjects scoring &gt; 11.5 and poor summarizers scored &lt; 10. Sample sizes and comprehension test and summary scores appear in <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>.

Good comprehenders scored significantly higher than poor comprehenders, 
<em>F</em>(1, 75) = 675.67, <em>MS</em>e = 10,572.98, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. The mean condition effect is significant, 
<em>F</em>(4, 75) = 5.66, <em>MS</em>e = 88.60, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, but the interaction is not. A <em>t</em> test was used to compare control group performance against performance of the other groups. Good comprehenders’ scores only improved significantly in the two conditions where the macrostructure was underlined; the macro group scores are significantly higher than scores for the control group: <em>t</em>(14) = 4.12, <em>p</em> &lt; .01. The scores for the macro and frame group are significantly higher than scores for the control group: <em>t</em>(13) = 4.76, <em>p</em> &lt; .01.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Frame information had no effect on comprehension, either because it was not necessary for comprehension or because good comprehenders implemented an adequate problem frame, hence making this information redundant. To clarify this issue, control group summaries were analyzed to assess the frame knowledge of subjects who read texts with no aids. The number of nodes present in the summary was calculated for each subject. Out of a maximum of 5 nodes, good comprehenders reproduced on the average of 4.14 nodes, in contrast to poor comprehenders who averaged only 2.20. Thus good comprehenders were familiar with the notion of problem frames. This suggests that frame annotations did not affect performance because they were in fact redundant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However it should be pointed out that knowledge of the problem frame is not sufficient for perfect comprehension scores. The high scores obtained by subjects who read the text containing underlined macrostructure suggest that frame activation precedes macrostructure construction. Thus the frame may serve as an intermediary which facilitates the construction of the macrostructure. The implication is that readers need to learn how to use a frame to understand a text. Good comprehenders who did not have perfect scores may not have completely mastered the operations underlying the transition from frame to macrostructure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The comparison with poor comprehender findings is striking. Orthogonal, single-degree-of-freedom contrasts show that all aids significantly improved performance in poor comprehenders, 
<em>F</em>(1, 35) = 6.43, <em>MS</em>e = 130.75, <em>p</em> &lt; .01, but no form of annotation is better than another.

The results exhibit similar trends. Good summarizers scored significantly higher than poor summarizers, 
<em>F</em>(1, 77) = 645.80, <em>MS</em>e = 11,242.77, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. The mean condition effect is significant, 
<em>F</em>(4, 77) = 6.05, <em>MS</em>e = 105.30, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, but the interaction is not significant. Good summarizers only improved significantly in conditions where the macrostructure was underlined. Macro group scores are significantly higher than scores for the control group, <em>t</em>(13) = 4.62, <em>p</em> &lt; .01. As on the comprehension test, all the aids significantly improved poor summarizers’ performances 
<em>F</em>(1, 45) = 7.48, <em>MS</em>e = 47.92, <em>p</em> &lt; .001 (single degree of freedom contrasts), but no form of annotation was better than another.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Poor summarizers produced texts that were as long as those written by good summarizers but were poorly organized, as though the text they read did not have a frame. These subjects tended to write summaries that mentioned details, examples, and secondary information but they did not include the main topic points. Good summarizers and poor summarizers thus have comparable memory capacities (because their summaries were the same length). However, good summarizers are able to present the relevant information while poor summarizers are unable to hierarchize the information in the text. Annotations improved performance, but had little or no effect on processing strategies. The aids were used as local information but did not trigger or activate the necessary operations for good text comprehension. This is further shown by the fact that none of the aids enabled poor comprehenders/ summarizers to reach the performance level of the good comprehenders and summarizers in the control group who were not provided with any type of annotation.</p><a id="edu-82-4-727-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_64" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, the findings show that the efficiency of aids varies as a function of skill. Performance of good comprehenders and good summarizers only shows significant improvement when they are given macrostructure aids. In contrast, poor comprehenders and poor summarizers benefit from all the aids although no one aid was efficient enough for them to match the performance levels of good comprehenders and good summarizers in the control group who received no form of aid.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings are congruent with a comprehension model that specifies three categories of operations. The first operation consists of constructing a frame from a text grammar. The second operation consists of using this frame to identify important information, which is processed in the third step to build up a semantic representation of the text. Within this framework, the inefficiency of frame information aids for good comprehenders, as well as analysis of the structure of their summaries, show that fifth-grade good comprehenders and good summarizers are familiar with the frames for problem-solution texts but have not completely mastered the operations needed to construct a semantic representation of the text. Frame information can thus help them identify important information, but does not lead to full comprehension.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The data for poor comprehenders and poor summarizers are more problematic because low scores may be due to difficulties these readers encountered in constructing a frame, or may reflect the fact that they did not implement a strategy corresponding to the <a href="#c20">van Dijk and Kintsch (1983)</a> model. These readers have problems identifying important information and tend to process text information as separate elements rather than forming a hierarchical information structure, which is the only procedure that yields high scores. The implication is that students should be taught about frames, since this knowledge is likely to help them differentiate main points from secondary information in a text.</p><a id="edu-82-4-727-ID0EUABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_70" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Adam, J.
