A student trying to complete a term paper, for instance, may find his or her concentration diverted jointly by colorful posters on the wall, the grating sound of a vacuum cleaner in a nearby room, and his or her own sluggishness from poor typing skills. In the laboratory, many of the contextual factors that compete for attention have been enumerated through investigations of the Stroop task, which is among the most dependable techniques for rattling concentration (<a href="#c46">MacLeod, 1992</a>). In a classic study, <a href="#c80">Stroop (1935)</a> discovered an asymmetry in selective attention to colors versus words. Stroop's participants were able to read words printed in incongruent colors (e.g., the word RED printed in green) as quickly as words printed in black. Hence, their selective attention to the word dimension was excellent, unaffected by color distraction. However, his participants were significantly slower to name the colors of incongruent words than to name the colors of squares. In other words, their selective attention to the color dimension was poor, undermined by word distraction. The traditional <em>Stroop asymmetry</em> refers to this imbalance in selective attention performance: Words distract attention from color targets, but colors do not distract attention from word targets.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EHCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_10" title="Asymmetric Selection Failure Versus Global Selection Failure">Asymmetric Selection Failure Versus Global Selection Failure</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Amongthe contextual factors that contribute to <a href="#c80">Stroop's (1935)</a> effect, a critical one is the psychophysical characteristics of the stimuli. <a href="#c59">Melara and Mounts (1993)</a> systematically varied the visual angle of color words, thereby manipulating the relative speeds to read the words or to name their colors. These investigators found that Stroop asymmetry could be determined fully by the psychophysical context. In particular, for visual angles in which the words were more discriminable than the colors (as determined by baseline speeds), Melara and Mounts reproduced the usual Stroop asymmetry; when the words and the colors were matched in discriminability, the asymmetry strikingly disappeared; and when the colors were more discriminable than the words, the asymmetry actually reversed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The fact that the Stroop asymmetry can be eliminated or reversed at will implies that context controls both the direction and the extent of selective attention failure.<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup>
Moreover, whereas certain contextual factors might modulate the relative degree of asymmetry between Stroop (or other) dimensions, other factors mayhave their primary influence on the absolute level of distraction when one is performing attention tasks. We, therefore, find it useful to distinguish conceptually between an <em>asymmetric failure</em> of selective attention, defined as the difference in attentional interference between the dimensions, and a <em>global failure,</em> defined as the absolute or average amount of interference across the dimensions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The conceptual dissociation between asymmetric failure and global failure can be appreciated by comparing the distinct outcomes observed between different types of perceptual dimensions during speeded classification. Consider first the integral dimensions of color saturation and brightness. As depicted in the left side of <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, integral dimensions show substantial global failure of selective attention across most task and stimulus contexts (e.g., 100 ms in Context A and 75 ms in Context B) yet little or no asymmetric failure in any context (e.g., <a href="#c58">Melara, Marks, &amp; Potts, 1993b</a>). Consider, by contrast, a pair of separable dimensions, such as circle size and diameter orientation. As depicted in the right side of <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, under many psychophysical contexts, separable dimensions display an asymmetric failure in one direction or the other (e.g., asymmetric failure equals 50 ms in Context B1 and −50 ms in Context B2; see <a href="#c21">Garner, 1983</a>; <a href="#c22">Garner &amp; Felfoldy, 1970</a>). Furthermore, unlike integral dimensions, separable dimensions evince a complete absence of global failure under certain contexts (<a href="#c19">Garner, 1974</a>; <a href="#c22">Garner &amp; Felfoldy, 1970</a>; <a href="#c72">Potts, Melara, &amp; Marks, 1998</a>). In this regard, <a href="#c59">Melara and Mounts (1993)</a> concluded that Stroop dimensions are more akin to separable dimensions than to integral dimensions because, under many contexts, colors and words yielded an asymmetric failure of selective attention whereas, under certain contexts, both asymmetric and global failure were eliminated.<br /><br /><a id="fig1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/692b85ce78be73660853c512fba1a69b/571c64a3/pdh/xhp/xhp-27-3-515-fig1a.gif" alt="xhp-27-3-515-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

We propose that the contextual factors that control global failures are materially distinct from those that control asymmetric failures. This idea is depicted in the right side of <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. Note here that Context A reduces the degree of global failure in classifying Stroop stimuli (i.e., global failure drops from 75 ms in Context A1 to 50 ms in Context A2) while maintaining the Stroop asymmetry (i.e., asymmetric failure equals 50 ms in Contexts A1 and A2 ), whereas Context B modulates asymmetric failure (i.e., the Stroop asymmetry reverses from 50 ms in Context B1 to −50 ms in Context B2) independent of global distractibility (i.e., global failure equals 75 ms in Contexts B1 and B2 ). In the present study, for each of four contextual factors (described in the section <em>Contextual Influences on Task and Congruity Effects</em>), we measured degrees of asymmetric failure and global failure for each of several separate indices of Stroop distraction. By empirically dissociating contextual factors in this way, we sought to identify distinct processing mechanisms that operate in Stroop classification and in other selective attention situations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of course, even if two contexts primarily influence separate types of selection failure, their effects are unlikely to be completely independent of each other. To gain a full understanding of the nature of attentional processing, therefore, it is important also to examine the interactive character of context. Unfortunately, little is known about the collective influences of individual contexts on selective attention, despite their strong bearing on attentional theory. In the present study, we took the position that the Stroop phenomenon arises from a confluence of contexts. Our initial experiment mimicked the set of contexts used by <a href="#c80">Stroop (1935)</a> himself. By then systematically changing these contexts within and across the subsequent experiments, we sought gradually to balance asymmetric failure and to eliminate global failure. This approach enabled us, over the course of experiments, to document the individual and joint influences of each of Stroop's original contexts.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EGCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_18" title="Measures of Distraction in Stroop Tasks">Measures of Distraction in Stroop Tasks</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In modern applications of <a href="#c80">Stroop's (1935)</a> procedure, color words from a specified stimulus set (e.g., RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW), each printed in either a congruent color (e.g., RED in red) or an incongruent color (e.g., RED in blue), appear one at a time on a display screen. A participant is timed in identifying either the word (i.e., word judgments) or its color (i.e., color judgments) while ignoring values along the unresponded (word or color) dimension. The dimension being judged is the target dimension; the dimension being ignored is the distractor dimension. Responses are usually made by either speaking (i.e., oral response mode) or pressing an identifying key (i.e., manual response mode). The main dependent variable is reaction time (RT) from stimulus onset, although we also examined response accuracy in this study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several conventions exist to combine the words and colors that appear in a block of Stroop trials. As in previous studies (<a href="#c1">Algom, Dekel, &amp; Pansky, 1996</a>; <a href="#c52">Melara, 1989a</a>; <a href="#c56">Melara &amp; Marks, 1990</a>; <a href="#c59">Melara &amp; Mounts, 1993</a>, <a href="#c60">1994</a>; <a href="#c61">Melara &amp; O'Brien, 1987</a>; <a href="#c65">Pansky &amp; Algom, 1999</a>), we adopted the allocation policies specified in <a href="#c19">Garner's (1974)</a> speeded classification paradigm, which provide tight methodological control over the conditional relations between values from the relevant and irrelevant dimensions. For each type of classification (i.e., color or word), four Stroop tasks were created. The tasks differed from one another in target–distractor contingencies but were identical in the judgments required of participants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the <em>baseline</em> task, only the target dimension could change from trial to trial (e.g., RED, GREEN, BLUE, or YELLOW might appear as a word target on a trial); the distractor dimension was held constant at one value (e.g., each word would appear in the distractor color green). In the <em>filtering</em> task, a value was selected at random from the target dimension and paired, on each trial, with a value selected at random from the distractor dimension. Thus, all possible combinations of word and color appeared in the filtering task, creating a zero correlation between the two dimensions. In the <em>positively correlated</em> task, a value from the target dimension (e.g., RED or GREEN) was paired on each trial with a matching value from the distractor dimension (e.g., RED in red, GREEN in green). Thus, all stimuli were congruent in the positively correlated task; the two dimensions had a perfect positive correlation. Finally, in the <em>negatively correlated</em> task, a value from the target dimension was paired on each trial with a mismatching value from the distractor dimension (e.g., RED in green, GREEN in red). Thus, all stimuli were incongruent in the negatively correlated task; the two dimensions had a perfect negative correlation.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0ECGCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Congruity Effects and Task Effects</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two separate classes of performance effects—congruity effects and task effects—can be derived in the Garner speeded classification paradigm, each an independent measure of the intrusiveness of distractors on selectivity to the targets (see <a href="#c65">Pansky &amp; Algom, 1999</a>; <a href="#c69">Pomerantz, 1991</a>; <a href="#c86">van Leeuwen &amp; Bakker, 1995</a>). A <em>congruity effect</em> is the difference within a condition between the average performance (speed or accuracy) on incongruent trials (i.e., trials involving stimuli that mismatch along the two dimensions) and the average performance on congruent trials. In the present study, we examined congruity effects under three conditions: (a) the baseline task, (b) the filtering task, and (c) the correlated tasks. Congruity effects differing reliably from zero indicate that the distractor's semantic, orthographic, and/or acoustic qualities significantly influenced target classifications (e.g., <a href="#c13">Dalrymple-Alford, 1972</a>; <a href="#c15">Dyer, 1973</a>; <a href="#c56">Melara &amp; Marks, 1990</a>; <a href="#c70">Pomerantz, Pristach, &amp; Carson, 1989</a>; <a href="#c71">Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975</a>). Thus, congruity effects represent an intracondition measure of the failure of participants to attend selectively to the target dimension.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Congruity effects may be unequal across the baseline, filtering, and correlated tasks, even when each task consists of equal numbers of congruent and incongruent trials (e.g., <a href="#c9">Clark &amp; Brownell, 1976</a>; <a href="#c56">Melara &amp; Marks, 1990</a>). Such differences across tasks imply that the specific relations between the target dimension and the distractor dimension play a fundamental role in selective attention failure. In particular, the degree of intrusiveness of distractors may change from the baseline task, when the distractor dimension is held constant; to the filtering task, when the distractor dimension is varied orthogonally with the target dimension; to the correlated tasks, when the distractor dimension is covaried with the target dimension. Moreover, depending on context, intrusiveness may be expressed as a change in global failure, in asymmetric failure, or in both. Unfortunately, in modern Stroop studies, congruity effects are usually measured only in a single context and only when the dimensions are correlated positively, with the conditional probability of a word given its matching (congruent) color invariably exceeding the probability of any other combination of word and color (e.g., <a href="#c8">Brown, Roos-Gilbert, &amp; Carr, 1995</a>; <a href="#c14">Dunbar &amp; MacLeod, 1984</a>; <a href="#c40">Lindsay &amp; Jacoby, 1994</a>; <a href="#c47">MacLeod, 1998</a>; <a href="#c73">Proctor, 1978</a>; <a href="#c79">Spieler, Balota, &amp; Faust, 1996</a>; <a href="#c84">Treisman &amp; Fearnley, 1969</a>; <a href="#c85">Tzelgov, Henik, &amp; Berger, 1992</a>; <a href="#c87">Virzi &amp; Egeth, 1985</a>). These studies thus miss potential interactive effects of context on tasks. To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the first systematic attempt to identify the distinct roles of context on global and asymmetric failure for each of several target–distractor relations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Task effects</em> refer to comparisons between tasks, usually the difference in performance between an experimental task and the baseline task. In this study, the experimental tasks were the blocks of filtering, positively correlated, or negatively correlated trials. We examined three task effects in this study, one for each difference in performance (speed or accuracy) between an experimental task and baseline: (a) Garner interference = filtering − baseline (e.g., <a href="#c22">Garner &amp; Felfoldy, 1970</a>; see also <a href="#c67">Pomerantz, 1983</a>, <a href="#c68">1986</a>), (b) redundancy gain = positively correlated − baseline (e.g., <a href="#c7">Biederman &amp; Checkosky, 1970</a>; <a href="#c62">Monahan &amp; Lockhead, 1977</a>), and (c) redundancy loss = negatively correlated − baseline (e.g., <a href="#c52">Melara, 1989a</a>). Task effects differing reliably from zero (or, equivalently, from one another) indicate that participants did not ignore the trial-to-trial variation along the distractor dimension, whether it helped (e.g., redundancy gain) or hindered (e.g., Garner interference) their target classifications. Task effects thus represent an intertask measure of the failure of participants to attend selectively to the target dimension.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EBGCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Stroop Interference and Stroop Facilitation</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c80">Stroop (1935)</a>, in his original study, used a task measure analogous to redundancy loss to assess the RT differences in attending to colors versus words: He compared performance in a negatively correlated experimental task (i.e., one involving only incongruent stimuli) with performance in a special type of baseline task (i.e., one involving neither congruent nor incongruent stimuli). In many modern Stroop studies, a measure of <em>Stroop interference</em> is derived by subtracting performance at baseline (or to special control stimuli) from performance to incongruent stimuli. In a similar manner, a measure of <em>Stroop facilitation</em> can be derived by subtracting performance at baseline from performance to congruent stimuli. Both measures indicate a selection failure (see Footnote 1).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As in the case of congruity effects, modern studies typically examine Stroop interference and Stroop facilitation only in a single context and only in correlated tasks. The usual finding is that the magnitude of Stroop interference significantly outweighs the magnitude of Stroop facilitation (e.g., <a href="#c13">Dalrymple-Alford, 1972</a>; <a href="#c14">Dunbar &amp; MacLeod, 1984</a>; <a href="#c24">M. O. Glaser &amp; Glaser, 1982</a>; <a href="#c25">W. R.

O. Glaser &amp; Glaser, 1982</a>). In the present study, we derived Stroop interference and Stroop facilitation in the correlated and filtering tasks, examining global failure and asymmetric failure to each measure across contexts. To forecast our results, we found that the relations between interference and facilitation change dramatically depending on task, context, and type of selection failure. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first systematic attempt to disentangle the distinct and interactive roles of context on Stroop facilitation and Stroop interference.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EAGCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Deriving Asymmetric Failure and Global Failure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A contextually induced change in a task effect or a congruity effect can represent an asymmetric failure, a global failure, or both. In the present study, asymmetric failure was defined as the difference in a task or congruity effect between color judgments and word judgments. Thus, asymmetric failure gauges the degree to which distraction undermined classification performance to one dimension relative to the other (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Asymmetry scores reliably greater than zero identified a traditional Stroop asymmetry, whereas scores reliably less than zero identified a reverse Stroop asymmetry. Global failure was defined as the average (absolute) task or congruity effect across the two dimensions. Thus, global failure measures the overall extent of disruption in performance within a given context. Note that, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, two contexts may induce different degrees of global failure but equivalent Stroop asymmetries (see top right of <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) or differing Stroop asymmetries but equivalent degrees of global failure (see bottom right of <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_36" title="Contextual Influences on Task and Congruity Effects">Contextual Influences on Task and Congruity Effects</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The context of a Stroop task is the setting within which color or word judgments are made. Contextual influences divide into several classes depending on whether psychophysical (e.g., physical stimulus value), mechanical (e.g., response modality), or relational (e.g., stimulus probability) parameters are changed (see <a href="#c60">Melara &amp; Mounts, 1994</a>). In the present study, we manipulated four variables of context: (a) the psychophysical context, (b) the set size context, (c) the production context, and (d) the covariate context. As we review next, previous evidence has suggested that each of these contexts may individually produce systematic changes in global or asymmetric failure of task and congruity effects.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EDFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Psychophysical Context</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The psychophysical context refers to stimulus manipulations that alter the relative discriminabilities between the dimensions observed at baseline (<a href="#c21">Garner, 1983</a>). In <a href="#c80">Stroop's (1935)</a> original study, the word dimension was far more discriminable than the color dimension; that is, participants were faster to read words printed in black, a baseline word task, than they were to name the colors of squares, a baseline color task. The psychophysical context of Stroop's study was therefore biased in favor of word discrimination.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recent research has demonstrated that the psychophysical context can amplify the magnitudes of Stroop effects (<a href="#c1">Algom et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c6">Ben-Artzi &amp; Marks, 1995</a>; <a href="#c32">Gumenik &amp; Glass, 1970</a>; <a href="#c59">Melara &amp; Mounts, 1993</a>, <a href="#c60">1994</a>; <a href="#c64">Palef &amp; Olson, 1975</a>; <a href="#c65">Pansky &amp; Algom, 1999</a>). For example, as we described earlier, <a href="#c59">Melara and Mounts (1993)</a> showed that Garner interference and congruity effects were larger in judging color than in judging word when the psychophysical context favored word discrimination but were larger in judging word than in judging color when the psychophysical context favored color discrimination. Algom et al. found comparable results in an investigation of the Stroop analogue dimensions of numerical magnitude (e.g., the numbers 3 and 7) and physical size (i.e., large and small). However, <a href="#c14">Dunbar and MacLeod (1984)</a> discovered that stimulus manipulations of relative discriminability do not necessarily affect the Stroop asymmetry. In their study, transformed words (e.g., upside down and backward) were discriminated more slowly than colors but were nonetheless effective in undermining color selection.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present study, we varied the psychophysical context, again through manipulations of visual angle, to examine its influence on the processing of Stroop color–word stimuli across a broader array of task and congruity effects than had been tested in previous research. Our analysis focused on the type of selection failure engendered by changes in psychophysical context. Previous research (e.g., <a href="#c1">Algom et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c59">Melara &amp; Mounts, 1993</a>, <a href="#c60">1994</a>) led us to expect that psychophysical manipulations would target the asymmetry of selection failures. One possibility is that systematic shifts toward relatively improved color discrimination will cause progressively greater intrusion of color on word selection, balanced by progressively weaker intrusion of words on color selection. In this scenario, a change in psychophysical context would create a more negative asymmetric failure but constant global failure. This result would be consistent with explanations of the Stroop asymmetry based on the relative speed of dimensional processing (i.e., a horse-race model; e.g., <a href="#c15">Dyer, 1973</a>; <a href="#c37">Klein, 1964</a>; <a href="#c64">Palef &amp; Olson, 1975</a>), which would interpret the effect of psychophysical change as initiating a winning streak in the color-processing horse.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A second possibility is that reductions in stimulus visual angle merely reduce the disruptive influence of words on colors by making words less readable. In this case, we would expect the change in psychophysical context to drive both the asymmetric failure and the global failure (and, hence, both congruity effects and task effects) toward zero. This result would be consistent with explanations that accord the Stroop asymmetry to the relative automaticity of word reading (e.g., <a href="#c33">Hasher &amp; Zacks, 1979</a>; <a href="#c41">Logan, 1980</a>; <a href="#c48">MacLeod &amp; Dunbar, 1988</a>), with automatic activation presumably being triggered less often as words are made less readable.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0ECFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Set Size Context</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The set size context refers to the number of values in a stimulus set. In <a href="#c80">Stroop's (1935)</a> study, the set contained 20 stimuli (all incongruent pairings of five words and five colors). Researchers who have varied set size context have often (e.g., <a href="#c36">Kanne, Balota, Spieler, &amp; Faust, 1998</a>; <a href="#c82">Taylor, 1977</a>; <a href="#c89">Williams, 1977</a>), but not always (see <a href="#c27">Golden, 1974</a>; <a href="#c50">McClain, 1983a</a>; <a href="#c75">Ray, 1974</a>; for a review, see <a href="#c45">MacLeod, 1991</a>), observed corresponding changes in the magnitude of Stroop effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Interpretation of previous research on set size context has been hampered by one of two problems. First, in many of the earlier studies (e.g., <a href="#c23">Gholson &amp; Hohle, 1968</a>; <a href="#c27">Golden, 1974</a>; <a href="#c75">Ray, 1974</a>), only responses to incongruent pairings of colors and words were examined, thereby preventing calculation of congruity effects. Second, in the more recent studies of set size context (e.g., <a href="#c36">Kanne et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#c50">McClain, 1983a</a>), which have included both congruent and incongruent stimuli in the set, set size was confounded with the conditional probability of a target given a congruent distractor. For example, in the study by Kanne et al., as stimulus set size was increased, congruent stimuli were made to appear more predictably within the task (see also <a href="#c50">McClain, 1983a</a>). Because both set size context and conditional probability influence stimulus uncertainty (<a href="#c18">Garner, 1962</a>; <a href="#c60">Melara &amp; Mounts, 1994</a>), it has been impossible to determine from these studies whether set size has an independent influence on task and congruity effects. In the present study, both problems were rectified. Here, we manipulated set size context independently of the conditional probabilities between stimulus values, thereby providing an unconfounded test of the effects of set size on task and congruity measures.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We expected that set size context, in contrast to psychophysical context, would exert its primary influence on the global rates of selective attention failure. Our reasoning was that as the number of possible targets increases with set size, the probability that any specific target will appear decreases, making its actual appearance more uncertain (and, therefore, informative) to the perceiver (see <a href="#c3">Attneave, 1959</a>; <a href="#c12">Coombs, Dawes, &amp; Tversky, 1970</a>; <a href="#c44">Luce, 1960</a>). In other words, set size affects stimulus uncertainty, which is known to exacerbate failures of selective attention (<a href="#c28">Graham, 1989</a>; <a href="#c60">Melara &amp; Mounts, 1994</a>). We predicted, therefore, that a change in set size context would lead to differences in global failure while generally maintaining degrees of asymmetric failure. Such a pattern would dissociate the attentional processes triggered by set size context from those involved in psychophysical context, which were expected instead to shift asymmetric failure more directly than global failure.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EBFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Production Context</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The production context refers to the modality that participants use to render their classification responses. In <a href="#c80">Stroop's (1935)</a> study, the response mode was oral: Participants read words or named colors aloud as quickly as possible. In this vocal production context, Stroop found that word distractors interfered with color judgments (relative to baseline) but that color distractors did not affect word judgments. Subsequent research has demonstrated that preexisting associations between the response modality and the stimulus dimensions affect the magnitudes of observed Stroop effects (<a href="#c5">Baldo, Shimamura, &amp; Prinzmetal, 1998</a>; <a href="#c17">Flowers, Warner, &amp; Polansky, 1979</a>; <a href="#c34">Henik, Ro, Merrill, Rafal, &amp; Safadi, 1999</a>; <a href="#c51">McClain, 1983b</a>; <a href="#c87">Virzi &amp; Egeth, 1985</a>). In the case of Stroop's study, there was a preexisting association between the oral response mode and the word dimension, due to the high stimulus–response compatibility between words and speaking (e.g., <a href="#c51">McClain, 1983b</a>; <a href="#c87">Virzi &amp; Egeth, 1985</a>; see also <a href="#c74">Proctor &amp; Reeve, 1990</a>) and to the extensive practice that adults have had in responding to words through speech (e.g., <a href="#c10">Cohen et al., 1990</a>; <a href="#c48">MacLeod &amp; Dunbar, 1988</a>). By using a response mode more conducive to color classification—namely, sorting Stroop stimuli into bins labeled by a patch of color—Virzi and Egeth were able to reverse Stroop's findings, showing that color distractors could interfere with word judgments more than word distractors interfered with color judgments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To examine the effects of production context in our study, we compared two response modalities—oral (speaking) and manual (keypressing)—within otherwise identical classification environments. Previous research has shown that a change from the vocal context to the manual context reduces the magnitude of Stroop effects (<a href="#c51">McClain, 1983b</a>; <a href="#c59">Melara &amp; Mounts, 1993</a>; <a href="#c76">Redding &amp; Gerjets, 1977</a>; <a href="#c87">Virzi &amp; Egeth, 1985</a>). It is unknown, however, whether this magnitude reduction is attributable to a negative shift in asymmetric selection failure, to a decrease in global failure, or to both. Studies by <a href="#c51">McClain (1983b)</a> and by <a href="#c87">Virzi and Egeth (1985</a>, Experiment 2), which held all nonproduction contexts constant, demonstrated that a switch from oral to manual responding affects asymmetric failures of selection, flipping the direction of asymmetry scores from positive to negative, in line with models of coding translation (<a href="#c26">W. R. Glaser &amp; Glaser, 1989</a>; <a href="#c81">Sugg &amp; McDonald, 1994</a>; <a href="#c87">Virzi &amp; Egeth, 1985</a>). However, the aforementioned study by <a href="#c59">Melara and Mounts (1993)</a>, which manipulated both production context and psychophysical context, indicated that mode of responding can also attenuate global failure, suggesting the possibility that response processes interact with earlier perceptual processes. In the present study, we factorially varied the production context and the psychophysical context in an effort to clarify the exact role or roles of response mode in producing distraction during Stroop classification.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EAFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Covariate Context</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The covariate context refers to the probabilistic relations (correlation) between the target dimension and the distractor dimension. In <a href="#c80">Stroop's (1935)</a> study, all stimuli in the experimental tasks were incongruent (i.e., the conditional probability of a target given an incongruent distractor was 1.0), creating a correlation of −.25 between values on the color and word dimensions. One can say, therefore, that Stroop's experimental tasks involved a substantial redundancy between target and distractor dimensions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Early studies on the role of redundancy in speeded classification focused on its beneficial effects. With integral dimensions (e.g., saturation and brightness), performance on a correlated task leads invariably to redundancy gain relative to baseline (see <a href="#c19">Garner, 1974</a>, <a href="#c20">1976</a>). In neglecting to fully select the nominally criterial dimension, the observer's classification performance is actually enhanced, perhaps through probability summation (<a href="#c29">Graham, Kramer, &amp; Yager, 1987</a>), perceptual integration (<a href="#c35">Hyman &amp; Well, 1967</a>; <a href="#c83">Torgerson, 1958</a>), or the adoption of an integrative decision rule (<a href="#c2">Ashby &amp; Maddox, 1994</a>; <a href="#c90">Zagorski, 1975</a>). For pairs of dimensions for which values have a correspondence or congruence quality (e.g., <a href="#c9">Clark &amp; Brownell, 1976</a>; <a href="#c52">Melara, 1989a</a>; <a href="#c77">Redding &amp; Tharp, 1981</a>; <a href="#c88">Walker &amp; Smith, 1984</a>), it is possible to distinguish meaningfully between a positively correlated task, in which congruent stimuli predominate, and a negatively correlated task like <a href="#c80">Stroop's (1935)</a> task, in which incongruent stimuli predominate. Previous research has indicated that the direction of correlation between Stroop-like dimensions determines whether observers are aided or hindered (relative to baseline) by a failure of selective attention (see Footnote 1): Positive covariate contexts generally yield redundancy gain (e.g., <a href="#c1">Algom et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c61">Melara &amp; O'Brien, 1987</a>), whereas negative contexts frequently produce redundancy loss (e.g., <a href="#c52">Melara, 1989a</a>; <a href="#c56">Melara &amp; Marks, 1990</a>). The relatively poor performance of Stroop's participants in naming color words (vs. colored squares) was perhaps the first example of redundancy loss in classification of Stroop dimensions. Redundancy loss has been modeled formally as an asymmetric shift of perceived stimulus values in multidimensional space (<a href="#c2">Ashby &amp; Maddox, 1994</a>; see also <a href="#c49">Maddox, 1992</a>; <a href="#c52">Melara, 1989a</a>, <a href="#c53">1989b</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In modern Stroop studies, it is often difficult to assess the effects of covariate context because many investigators mix values along the color–word dimension with noncolor- or XXXX-control values. The addition of these control values to the set increases the uncertainty of individual stimuli during performance of the task (<a href="#c18">Garner, 1962</a>), complicating interpretation of behavioral outcomes. In a study by <a href="#c43">Lowe and Mitterer (1982)</a>, for example, the correlation between dimensions in different tasks was either negative, zero, or positive. In contrast to other research (e.g., <a href="#c1">Algom et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c9">Clark &amp; Brownell, 1976</a>; <a href="#c67">Pomerantz, 1983</a>), these investigators found redundancy loss (relative to <em>r</em> = .00) in both the negative context (<em>r</em> = −.54) and the positive contexts (<em>r</em> = .43 and <em>r</em> = .75), even when the performance to congruent stimuli in a task was considered alone. It may be that their addition of different proportions of noncolor-control values across tasks contributed to poor performance when dimensions were correlated positively.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recent research on the effects of covariate context has suggested that its primary influence may be on global failures of selective attention (<a href="#c1">Algom et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c6">Ben-Artzi &amp; Marks, 1995</a>; <a href="#c42">Logan &amp; Zbrodoff, 1979</a>; <a href="#c56">Melara &amp; Marks, 1990</a>). Furthermore, these studies revealed that the effects of positive covariate context invariably prevail over the effects of negative context. Ben-Artzi and Marks studied the synesthetically corresponding dimensions of visual position and auditory pitch, systematically varying both the covariate context (<em>r</em> = 1.0 or <em>r</em> = −1.0) and the psychophysical context (16 conditions created by factorial variation of four position differences and four pitch differences). Across psychophysical contexts, these authors found that the change from positive to negative covariate contexts eliminated global failure (from 18 ms to 1 ms) but had negligible effects on asymmetric failure. Such a pattern corresponds to the expected outcome of changes in set size context, which also involve manipulation of stimulus informativeness, suggesting that similar attentional processes may operate in these two contexts. The relatively greater global failure evident in the positive context also indicates that, at least within certain covariate settings, Stroop facilitation (which is equivalent to redundancy gain) can surpass Stroop interference (which is equivalent to redundancy loss), a reversal of the usual asymmetry between these measures (see <a href="#c45">MacLeod, 1991</a>, <a href="#c47">1998</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Within each of the six experiments of the present study, we varied the conditional probability of a target given a distractor by fixing the direction of correlation between dimensions, either positively (<em>r</em> = 1.0) or negatively (<em>r</em> = −1.0). This manipulation enabled us to examine the effects of covariate context on selection failure within each of the psychophysical, set size, and production contexts manipulated in this study. We expected that covariate context would affect global failure of selective attention, with failure to positive correlation (Stroop facilitation) exceeding failure to negative correlation (Stroop interference). We also predicted that covariate context would have scant influence on asymmetric selection failure across experiments. Nevertheless, we further considered that the effects of covariate context may depend on other contexts, which would be evidenced in the study by interactive changes in asymmetric failure across experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the first attempt to investigate systematically the role or roles of covariate context in different types of selective attention failure to Stroop dimensions.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_62" title="Organization of this Article">Organization of this Article</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Six experiments of similar methodology were conducted, each involving two types of judgments (i.e., color and word) in each of four tasks (i.e., baseline, filtering, positively correlated, and negatively correlated).

On each trial, XXREDXX, XGREENX, XXBLUEXX, or XYELLOWX appeared in the color red, green, blue, or yellow. Stimuli in Experiments 3, 4, 5, and 6 were drawn from a 2 (word: RED, GREEN) × 2 (color: red, green) matrix, whereas stimuli in Experiments 1 and 2 were drawn from a 4 × 4 matrix. Stimuli were generated on a Macintosh IIsi computer and displayed in Monaco font on the gray screen background of an Apple 13-in. (33.02-cm) MO401 monitor (66.7 Hz refresh rate). Hues corresponded to the following Munsell values: red = 2.5R/12C/4V, green = 2.5G/10C/5V, blue = 7.5PB/12C/4V, and yellow = 2.5Y/12C/7V.

In Experiments 2, 4, and 6, the words subtended 0.249° of visual angle in height (in width: XXREDXX = 1.162°, XGREENX = 1.162°, XXBLUEXX = 1.328°, and XYELLOWX = 1.328°).

The utility of the X flankers for this purpose, although nonstandard from the perspective of previous Stroop studies, is supported by the results of previous research in our laboratories (<a href="#c1">Algom et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c59">Melara &amp; Mounts, 1993</a>) and by pilot research conducted for the present study.

An experimenter sitting in the room, but having no visual contact with the screen, keyed in each participant's vocal response on each trial. Response accuracy was computed on-line.

Participants were asked to respond orally (Experiments 1–4) or manually (Experiments 5–6) to values along the relevant dimension while ignoring values along the distractor dimension. Each task comprised a block of 100 trials. Each value along the target dimension appeared randomly on each trial of each task.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The four tasks of each judgment type were (a) baseline, (b) filtering, (c) positively correlated, and (d) negatively correlated. In the baseline task, the target dimension varied randomly from trial to trial (e.g., color varied between red and green), whereas the distractor dimension was held constant at one of its values (e.g., the word was always RED). The value of the distractor dimension was counterbalanced across participants. In the filtering task, stimuli were selected at random from all the cells of the 2 × 2 matrix (.25 probability per stimulus) or the 4 × 4 matrix (.0625 probability per stimulus), thereby creating a zero correlation between the target dimension and the distractor dimension. In the positively correlated task, stimuli were selected equally from the cells along the major diagonal of the 2 × 2 matrix (.50 probability per stimulus) or the 4 × 4 matrix (.25 probability per stimulus), thereby creating a perfect positive correlation between dimensions. All stimuli in the positively correlated set were congruent. In the negatively correlated task, stimuli were selected equally from the cells along the minor diagonal of the 2 × 2 matrix (.50 probability per stimulus) or the 4 × 4 matrix (.25 probability per stimulus), thereby creating a perfect negative correlation between dimensions. All stimuli in the negatively correlated set were incongruent. The four tasks (baseline, filtering, positively correlated, and negatively correlated) within each type of judgment (color classification or word classification) were performed as a set. Order of judgment was counterbalanced across participants; order of task occurred randomly for each participant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible on each trial.

In this study, all main effects and interactions reported as significant were reliable after Greenhouse–Geisser (<a href="#c31">Greenhouse &amp; Geisser, 1959</a>) correction. The analysis revealed a main effect of task type, <em>F</em>(2, 46) = 54.59, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>MSE</em> = 1,540.48, with the effect of congruity significantly greater in the correlated tasks (89 ms) than in the filtering task (34 ms), which, in turn, was significantly greater than in the baseline task (6 ms), as evaluated by Newman–Keuls post hoc tests (.05 criterion level).

When the target dimension alone varied (i.e., in the baseline task), there was little attentional intrusion. When the target and distractor dimensions were varied at random (i.e., in the filtering task), however, selective attention faltered relative to the baseline task, even though both tasks involved the same ratio of congruent-to-incongruent trials (1:3) and in both tasks the distractor provided irrelevant response information across trials. It is interesting that when the two dimensions covaried (i.e., in the correlated tasks), the influence of the distractor was greatest, presumably because it was so informative about target identity. Later, we consider why attentional intrusion abounds in the correlated tasks but vanishes in the baseline task.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The ANOVA of RT congruity scores also revealed a main effect of dimension, <em>F</em>(1, 23) = 68.10, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>MSE</em> = 2,199.46, with the average RT congruity effect larger to color judgments (75 ms) than to word judgments (11 ms). This result confirmed our expectations that, given the particular contextual parameters used in this experiment, distraction would be heavily asymmetrical, with words distracting colors much more than colors distracted words. The obtained pattern corresponds to the traditional Stroop asymmetry. In addition, there was a significant interaction between task type and dimension, <em>F</em>(2, 46) = 41.06, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>MSE</em> = 1,702.11, because the asymmetry was strongest in the correlated tasks but imperceptible in the baseline task. This result suggests that the Stroop asymmetry, which <a href="#c80">Stroop (1935)</a> obtained in a (negatively) correlated task, may arise only when both the target dimension and the distractor dimension are varied.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results obtained in the baseline task have particular theoretical significance. The fact that neither a Stroop asymmetry nor an effect of congruity was obtained argues against the view that each Stroop trial begins an independent race between color and word processors. Instead, any attentional competition between processing channels in a Stroop task requires the perception of moment-to-moment change or uncertainty in the distractor, which makes each new trial dependent on memories of previous trials. In our view, selection failure is absent when only a single distractor value appears (i.e., the baseline task) because, compared with when there are multiple distractor values present (e.g., the filtering task), the invariant distractor supplies the perceiver with little information (i.e., uncertainty) about the stimulus to be classified. Thus, at baseline, perceivers are less driven to irrelevant information (<a href="#c55">Melara &amp; Algom, 2001</a>). By extension, these results reinforce our conception of the Stroop asymmetry as a form of dimensional interaction (e.g., as between integral or separable dimensions), because any dimension logically ceases to exist when held to a constant value. This conclusion is supported by recent research demonstrating the influence of similarity relations (e.g., distance relations among dimensional values derived from multidimensional scaling analyses) on processing of Stroop and Stroop-like dimensions (see <a href="#c38">Klopfer, 1996</a>; <a href="#c53">Melara, 1989b</a>, <a href="#c54">1992</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An ANOVA of error congruity scores revealed a significant effect of task type, <em>F</em>(2, 46) = 5.57, <em>p</em> &lt; .01, <em>MSE</em> = .03; the difference in errors between congruent and incongruent stimuli was greater in the filtering task (1.40%) than in the baseline task (0.35%) or the correlated tasks (0.30%).

This result rules out the conjecture that participants performed the positively correlated color task by reading the words, which could have served as an equally valid basis of classification in this task (<a href="#c67">Pomerantz, 1983</a>). Indeed, performance in the two positively correlated tasks (i.e., word and color), which were structurally identical, differed by more than 60 ms, <em>t</em>(23) = 5.58, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, strongly suggesting that participants judged only colors in the color task. Nevertheless, the finding of redundancy gain indicates that words strongly intruded on color judgments in the positively correlated color task.

As we mentioned before, the latter result indicates that redundancy in either a positive or a negative direction was beneficial to response accuracy, in spite of the redundancy loss in RT observed in the negatively correlated tasks. The filtering task, in contrast, caused error rates to rise, suggesting response confusion from orthogonal variation of dimensions.

In a similar way, measures of Stroop facilitation and Stroop interference were derived by subtracting baseline RTs from RTs to congruent and incongruent stimuli, respectively, in the filtering tasks. Unlike in the correlated tasks, however, in which congruent stimuli were classified significantly faster than baseline (i.e., redundancy gain), Stroop facilitation did not differ from zero when colors were being judged, <em>t</em>(23) = 0.76, <em>ns,</em> and was significantly greater than zero (i.e., slower than baseline) when words were being judged (14 ms), <em>t</em>(23) = 2.38, <em>p</em> = .02. These results suggest that the magnitude and direction of Stroop facilitation is affected tremendously by whether dimensions are correlated (i.e., large gain) or uncorrelated (i.e., small gain or even loss), an idea that we probed systematically in later analyses. Stroop interference exceeded Stroop facilitation both in color judgments (65 ms vs. 8 ms), <em>F</em>(1, 23) = 62.98, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, and in word judgments (25 ms vs. 14 ms), <em>F</em>(1, 23) = 8.40, <em>p</em> &lt; .01.

In particular, the results reinforce the appropriateness of the baseline task in evaluating contextual influences on Stroop facilitation and Stroop interference, as we report in the next section. The more commonly used referent for this purpose—performance to control stimuli (e.g., XXXX in red) embedded in a correlated or filtering task—is perhaps more problematic because (a) the control stimulus comprises an extreme or nonexistent value (e.g., XXXX) along the irrelevant dimension (e.g., words; see <a href="#c38">Klopfer, 1996</a>), hence compromising its presumed neutrality; (b) the choice of control value used (e.g., XXXX, color-unrelated word, orthographically legal nonword) can dramatically influence the relative magnitudes of facilitation and interference observed in the Stroop task (e.g., <a href="#c13">Dalrymple-Alford, 1972</a>; see also <a href="#c45">MacLeod, 1991</a>); and (c) the stimulus uncertainty of the Stroop task is heightened by the insertion of control stimuli, hence confounding the estimated processing effects with unmeasured informational effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A summary of post hoc comparisons of asymmetric failure in the experimental pairs is contained in <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>.

For example, performance in Experiment 2, which differed from Experiment 1 only in psychophysical context, was characterized by relatively smaller congruity effects in color classification balanced by relatively larger congruity effects in word classification (see <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>). The upshot was a significant shift across the two experiments in asymmetric failure but a constant level of global failure (cf. <a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a>).

In accord with our expectations, global failure to positive correlation (redundancy gain) significantly exceeded global failure to negative correlation (redundancy loss) across experiments (see <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). This finding with Stroop dimensions fits with our analysis of previous investigations of covariate context performed on Stroop-like dimensions (<a href="#c1">Algom et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c6">Ben-Artzi &amp; Marks, 1995</a>; <a href="#c42">Logan &amp; Zbrodoff, 1979</a>; <a href="#c56">Melara &amp; Marks, 1990</a>) in showing that the influence of the distractor dimension is significantly stronger when it correlates positively rather than negatively with the target dimension, despite equal cue validity across the direction of correlation. The same outcome has been obtained even when the distractor is an imperfect predictor of the target (e.g., <a href="#c42">Logan &amp; Zbrodoff, 1979</a>), thereby ruling out the hypothesis that participants allow one dimension to substitute fully for another. It behooves us to emphasize that, in each of these demonstrations, Stroop facilitation (redundancy gain) significantly outpaced Stroop interference (redundancy loss), a result opposite to that found in uncorrelated (filtering) contexts (see the <em>Global failure in Stroop facilitation and Stroop interference</em> section). Moreover, as we shall see, covariate context did not yield a main effect when asymmetric failure served as the dependent variable, indicating that the underlying attentional mechanism operates across dimensions and is not restricted to color classification. In acting chiefly on global selection failure, the effects of covariate context duplicate the effects of set size context reported earlier. The theoretical implications of the parallel effects of these two contexts are developed in the General Discussion section.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Asymmetric failure in redundancy gain and redundancy loss</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The average asymmetric failure from redundancy in each experiment is depicted in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>.

This pattern of results was obtained because asymmetry in redundancy gain shifted across experiments from strongly positive (i.e., a failure in color selection) to significantly negative (i.e., a failure in word selection), whereas asymmetry in redundancy loss remained moderately positive throughout the study (see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). The shift in redundancy gain (Stroop facilitation) was progressive across experiments, which demonstrates that the effect was modulated individually by each of the separate contextual changes. This finding indicates that participants interactively processed the positive covariate context with each of the three other contexts (psychophysical, set size, and production) to cause gradually less influence of words on color judgments and gradually more influence of colors on word judgments. In general, participants appeared more sensitive to changing environmental structure in the positive covariate context than in the negative covariate context, with the latter causing relatively less attentional intrusion (as measured by global failure) and more consistent symmetry between the dimensions across contexts (as measured by asymmetric failure). It is unclear from the present results, however, whether the behavioral differences found between covariate contexts lie in processing differences in information seeking, inhibitory control, or the evaluation of perceptual evidence in reaching classification decisions (see the <em>Global Failures of Selective Attention: Stimulus and Decisional Uncertainty</em> section in the General Discussion section).<br /><br /><a id="fig7"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/2dca1ede7179b71b6a73f012132d3c2d/571c64a3/pdh/xhp/xhp-27-3-515-fig7a.gif" alt="xhp-27-3-515-fig7a.gif" title="Figure 7.

Thus, the disparity is explained almost entirely by relative performance in filtering. Of course, their model may not capture all of the different disparity relations found across the Stroop literature (see <a href="#c45">MacLeod, 1991</a>). Nonetheless, an analysis of these studies reveals that an inverse relation (i.e., negative correlation) between Stroop facilitation and Stroop interference is common, even in studies that purport to dissociate the two measures (e.g., <em>r</em> = −.89 in <a href="#c48">MacLeod &amp; Dunbar, 1988</a>, from Phase 3 of <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>; <em>r</em> ≈ −.95 in <a href="#c47">MacLeod, 1998</a>, from integrated stimuli read in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>; and <em>r</em> = −.35 in <a href="#c85">Tzelgov et al., 1992</a>, from <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).

As we discuss later, the particular effects of covariate context on Stroop facilitation may be attributable to the special stimulus situation created when dimensions are positively correlated (see the <em>Global Failures of Selective Attention: Stimulus and Decisional Uncertainty</em> section in the General Discussion section).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Asymmetric failure in Stroop facilitation and Stroop interference</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The average asymmetric failure of Stroop facilitation and Stroop interference in the filtering task of each experiment is depicted in <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>.

In Experiment 1, color and word classification were tested in the Garner paradigm within contexts resembling those used in <a href="#c80">Stroop's (1935)</a> study; the results reproduced the classic Stroop asymmetry in both task effects and congruity effects, as well as the typical disparity in the filtering task between Stroop interference and Stroop facilitation. In the remaining experiments, four conceptually separate contexts were manipulated: (a) psychophysical context, the psychophysical distinctiveness among values along the two dimensions; (b) set size context, the number of distinct target–distractor combinations in a stimulus set; (c) production context, the modality used to respond to targets; and (d) covariate context, the correlation between target and distractor dimensions within a task. Each context was shown to have a systematic influence on both task and congruity effects: Psychophysical context and production context mainly regulated asymmetric failures of selective attention between the dimensions, whereas set size context and covariate context mainly governed global failures of selective attention.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The contexts were also shown to interact statistically with one another, as revealed by post hoc and factorial analyses. In particular, the positive covariate context interacted with each of the other contexts, demonstrating that the asymmetric effects of positive correlation were always stronger in one psychophysical, production, or set size context than another. Each of the contexts also interacted with task type, demonstrating that the intrusive effects of context occur only when distractor values vary across trials (i.e., in the correlated and filtering tasks). The baseline task was characterized by symmetric success of selective attention across changes in context; baseline performance displayed neither global nor asymmetric failures of selection in any experiment. Finally, the degree of disparity between Stroop interference and Stroop facilitation during filtering was shown to be a linear function of Garner interference (<em>r</em> = .98), suggesting that congruent and incongruent stimuli are similarly affected in processing by different contextual manipulations of global selection failure.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EDACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Automaticity and Horse-Race Models of the Stroop Asymmetry</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c80">Stroop (1935)</a> attributed the asymmetry in performance between color naming and word reading to differences in associative strengths, with color naming being the relatively weaker skill because of the comparatively little training humans have had with this activity. In line with Stroop's account, modern theories most often explain the Stroop asymmetry by invoking the concept of automaticity (<a href="#c33">Hasher &amp; Zacks, 1979</a>; <a href="#c39">LaBerge &amp; Samuels, 1974</a>; <a href="#c41">Logan, 1980</a>; <a href="#c71">Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975</a>): The extensive practice that literate adults have had in reading words has made this activity seem virtually effortless and involuntary (i.e., automatic), particularly when compared with color naming, which requires concentration and effort even for adults. Automaticity theories state, then, that the asymmetrically large influence of words on colors in the Stroop task arises from participants' efforts to overcome their automatic tendencies to read and speak the words when attempting to name the colors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In formal theories of the Stroop asymmetry (e.g., <a href="#c10">Cohen et al., 1990</a>; <a href="#c41">Logan, 1980</a>; <a href="#c66">Phaf, van der Heiden, &amp; Hudson, 1990</a>; <a href="#c91">Zhang, Zhang, &amp; Kornblum, 1999</a>), the concept of automaticity figures into speed-of-processing or strength-of-processing architectures. Because of the automaticity bestowed by training, words are theorized to be processed intrinsically more efficiently than colors. On most trials of a Stroop task, analysis of the word is thought to be completed sooner than analysis of the color, and hence to have an earlier and stronger influence in decision making and response production (e.g., <a href="#c15">Dyer, 1973</a>; <a href="#c37">Klein, 1964</a>; <a href="#c63">Morton &amp; Chambers, 1973</a>; <a href="#c71">Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975</a>). One analogy is a horse race in which the word horse usually beats the color horse to the response finish line. Such speed-of-processing architectures can explain both the baseline differences that <a href="#c80">Stroop (1935)</a> found between word and color dimensions—because the word horse finishes more quickly on average than the color horse—and the Stroop asymmetry in selective attention—because the fast word horse often disrupts decisions about the slow color horse, but not vice versa.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results from the present study bear strongly on traditional horse-race and automaticity accounts of the Stroop asymmetry. Our results showed that asymmetric failures of selective attention were controlled by the psychophysical and production contexts. As we described in the introduction, automaticity theories predict that our psychophysical manipulation would reduce the influence of words on colors by making words less readable, and thus automatically less activated. From this perspective, the predicted effect of psychophysical context is to push both asymmetric failure and global failure toward zero. This result was not obtained. Indeed, we found that a change in psychophysical context (e.g., from Experiment 1 to Experiment 2) often decreased asymmetric failure while maintaining global failure. In other words, contrary to automaticity theory, psychophysical change caused colors to intrude relatively more on word classification. A similar result was observed from changes in production context: The change in response mode from oral to manual across Experiments 4 to 6, for example, significantly shifted asymmetric failure from positive (failure to color) to negative (failure to word) while maintaining the degree of global failure (see <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>). Because color identification is not tied automatically to the manual response mode, the observed effects of a change in production context are anomalous from the vantage of automaticity theories.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Change in either the psychophysical context or the production context reset the relative discriminability of the dimensions at baseline. For example, by reducing stimulus visual angle from Experiment 1 to Experiment 2, we slowed baseline discrimination of words (i.e., Experiment 1: 500 ms vs. Experiment 2: 622 ms) while maintaining baseline speeds in color discrimination (i.e., Experiment 1: 661 ms vs. Experiment 2: 663 ms). In a similar manner, by changing the production context used in Experiment 3, in which baseline discrimination significantly favored the word dimension (word baseline = 515 ms, color baseline = 594 ms, <em>t</em>[23] = 6.80, <em>p</em> &lt; .001), Experiment 5 equated baseline speeds between the dimensions (word baseline = 402 ms, color baseline = 404 ms, <em>t</em>[23] = 0.22, <em>ns</em>). These results, together with the parallel effects of psychophysical and production context on asymmetric failure, support a class of horse-race models uncoupled from automaticity theory. The usual coupled model makes the automaticity predictions disconfirmed by our results. Uncoupled horse-race models can explain the observed shifts in asymmetric failure through concomitant shifts in relative baseline speed triggered by changes in psychophysical or production context. By this account, the relative discriminability of dimensions at baseline gauges the relative speed of processing between the horses in the race; our changes in psychophysical or production context affected the relations between the horses and thereby fixed the outcomes (i.e., asymmetric failures) of the race.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Neither the coupled nor the uncoupled horse-race models, however, can easily explain the success of asymmetric and global selection in the baseline task. According to these models, the race recurs on each new trial of the Stroop task, causing average performance on congruent trials, when the color and word horses race to the same classification decision, to excel over average performance on incongruent trials, when the horses race to conflicting classification decisions. Congruent and incongruent trials were mixed together in each baseline task of our study; in fact, during the last four experiments, each of the baseline tasks consisted of half congruent trials and half incongruent trials. Yet, baseline congruity effects were always meager in this study, and, more important, no contextual change, whether psychophysical or production, had any effect on the observed symmetry in selective attention failure, despite the large, contextually induced shifts in relative baseline speeds. Differences in the speed to process stimulus features are apparently insufficient to induce failures of selective attention. Attentional systems also require perceived dimensionality or uncertainty produced by trial-to-trial variation in the distractor values. Thus, traditional horse-race models are, at best, incomplete accounts of the influence of psychophysical or production context on asymmetric failure. As we discuss later, these models are also inadequate at capturing the effects of set size context or covariate context.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0ECACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Asymmetric Separability of Stroop Dimensions: The Role of Dimensional Imbalance</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of the present study are consistent with the view that Stroop dimensions are, in essence, separable dimensions. Like other separable dimensions, but unlike integral dimensions, asymmetric failures of selection to Stroop dimensions abound, varying in degree by the type of contextual change (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). One useful way of addressing the theoretical basis of the Stroop asymmetry, therefore, is to ask, What are the distinct types of processing mechanisms that give rise to asymmetric separability? The answer, we believe, lies in the similarities in processing among contexts found to produce similar attentional effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our discussion thus far has focused on the similar outcomes created by changes in the psychophysical context or the production context. At first blush, these two contexts would appear to be quite dissimilar to each other in terms of information processing. The psychophysical context involves the processing of physical features of the perceived stimulus, whereas the production context involves the processing of mechanical features of the required response. Still, what is important about both contexts from an information-processing viewpoint is that their manipulation alters the efficiency to classify values along one dimension relative to the other. Both the reduction in visual angle (e.g., from Experiment 1 to Experiment 2) and the change from oral to manual response mode (e.g., from Experiment 3 to Experiment 5) affected the relative performance in classifying colors versus words at baseline, when the distractor had little influence on target processing. One reason why these manipulations were so effective in regulating relative baseline speeds is that psychophysical and production contexts may each modify the habitual ways that participants use to discriminate between values along a dimension affecting, respectively, how participants perceive and respond to the dimensional values (cf. <a href="#c16">Eimer, Hommel, &amp; Prinz, 1995</a>). For example, efficiency of access to the perceptual representations of the words was probably hindered by reducing the visual angle of the stimuli. Analogously, motoric access to representations of different word responses was probably impeded by switching from the oral to the manual modality. In both cases, our contextual manipulations made it more or less difficult for participants to activate pre-experimental memories of dimensional values, thereby resetting the baseline performance relations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In our view, by fixing the relative efficiency of access to perceptual or motoric memories of dimensional values, the psychophysical and production contexts modulate the processing imbalance between the target dimension and the distractor dimension. We propose that whenever values along the distractor dimension are accessed, activated, and discriminated from one another much more readily than values along the target dimension, the distractor will disrupt selective attention to the target. For pairs of separable dimensions, including Stroop dimensions, asymmetric separability will arise in this situation, with relatively greater selective attention failure evident in the relatively less accessible dimension. Moreover, we claim that the degree of dimensional imbalance established by context modulates the degree of asymmetric failure observed in the classification task. In <a href="#c80">Stroop's (1935)</a> study, there was a large imbalance favoring the word dimension. The processing basis of the marked Stroop asymmetry in his and later studies was, in our view, the large imbalance between the color and word dimensions established by his particular psychophysical and production contexts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Note that our conception of processing imbalance emphasizes dimensional relations. Such relations are rooted in the degree of accessibility that observers have to the different values along each dimension. By our account, therefore, the reason that little distractor intrusion is evident in a baseline condition is that perceptual and motoric relations among different distractor values are not activated by this condition. Asymmetric failure of selection requires that observers experience dimensionality in the distractor, that is, change in distractor values across time or space.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The concept of dimensional imbalance bears some resemblance to the speed-of-processing notions proposed in horse-race models (e.g., <a href="#c63">Morton &amp; Chambers, 1973</a>; <a href="#c71">Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975</a>): In both frameworks, the time necessary to process the distractor is predictive of the magnitude of the Stroop asymmetry. Yet, dimensional imbalance is a theoretically more powerful idea because of its emphasis on experienced dimensionality. In horse-race models, analyses of a target value and a distractor value race toward a response-stage finish line. Fast processing of a distractor value can thus determine whether response latencies to the target will be relatively fast, when the stimulus is congruent, or relatively slow, when the stimulus is incongruent. Degree of within-dimension variation is not a feature of extant horse-race models. For example, it should matter little to the race (and hence to the behavioral outcome) whether the distractor is held constant (e.g., in a baseline task) or varied (e.g., in a filtering task) across a block of trials. The results of the present study, however, underscore the importance of variation in both the target and distractor dimensions—and thereby in the importance of computed dimensional relations—when accounting for the Stroop asymmetry. Our results more generally illustrate that the time required to process any particular stimulus (e.g., RED in green) depends fundamentally on the specific context in which that stimulus appears.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Current formal models (e.g., <a href="#c10">Cohen et al., 1990</a>; <a href="#c41">Logan, 1980</a>; <a href="#c66">Phaf et al., 1990</a>) also disregard within-dimension variation in explaining the genesis of the Stroop asymmetry. In the parallel-distributed model of <a href="#c10">Cohen et al. (1990)</a>, for example, the network is activated only by the input values of the Stroop stimulus appearing on the current trial; other values along the dimension are set to zero. Thus, although the network is exquisitely sensitive to the preexperimental experiences a perceiver has with the two dimensions, in the current version of the model no account is taken of the degree of variability along the distractor dimension within a task. The model would thus be unable to explain the effects of task type invariably observed in the experiments reported here. A representation of dimensional imbalance of the sort we have outlined would appear to be necessary to capture such results.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EBACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Global Failures of Selective Attention: Stimulus and Decisional Uncertainty</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A central finding of the present study was that each of the contexts that we manipulated mainly affected only one type of selective attention failure. We have discussed already the possible basis of asymmetric failures, which arise primarily from changes in either psychophysical or production context. We turn now to a consideration of the processes underlying global selection failures, which we found were controlled primarily by changes in either set size or covariate context. Neither automaticity models nor horse-race models suggest a ready mechanism to accommodate the observed variations in global selection failure. Consider, for example, the enhanced global failure seen in larger set sizes. To handle this effect, automaticity models first must assume that the degree to which words are automatically activated increases with set size. Moreover, because global failure is affected, these models would need to claim that colors also are activated automatically in larger stimulus sets. In a similar manner, for horse-race models to explain set size effects, they must assume that the word horse races relatively faster in larger sets on color classification trials but that the color horse races faster in these sets on word classification trials. Such assumptions have never appeared in any formal models of the Stroop phenomenon. Perhaps as a consequence, recent evidence has indicated that at least one of these models—<a href="#c10">Cohen et al.'s (1990)</a> connectionist model—is extremely poor at handling set size effects (<a href="#c36">Kanne et al., 1998</a>; see also <a href="#c11">Cohen, Usher, &amp; McClelland, 1998</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Insight into the roots of global selection failure can be gleaned by considering processing similarities between set size context and covariate context. In this regard, note that both contexts involve manipulations of stimulus probability. In the case of set size context, probability is varied within a dimension, whereas in the case of covariate context, probability is covaried between dimensions. Manipulations of stimulus probability determine the degree of stimulus uncertainty within a block of trials. In particular, the uncertainty of a specific target stimulus will be affected by either the number of possible targets that may appear in the environment (i.e., set size context) or the number and type of possible distractors associated with each target (i.e., covariate context; <a href="#c4">Baird &amp; Noma, 1978</a>; <a href="#c18">Garner, 1962</a>). As the number of possible targets increases, the probability that any specific target will appear decreases, making its actual appearance more informative to the perceiver. As the number of possible distractors that can be paired with a target increases, the probability that any specific stimulus combination will appear decreases, making its actual appearance more informative to the perceiver.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several different processing mechanisms might underlie the detrimental effects on classification of increased stimulus uncertainty. On the one hand, greater uncertainty in the target can either decrease the speed or amplitude of activation to a target representation or raise the background activation levels to nontarget representations along a dimension. On the other hand, because greater uncertainty in a distractor means greater information conveyed by the stimulus (in an information-theoretic sense), increased stimulus uncertainty either may trigger the activation of a distractor representation (i.e., information seeking) or may thwart efforts to exclude such activation. By operating similarly across the two classification dimensions, each of these processing mechanisms, either singly or collectively, would be expected to exacerbate global selection failure while maintaining asymmetric failure. Thus, the proposed mechanisms serve as an explanation of the attentional effects of uncertainty as caused, for example, by changes in set size context: Greater uncertainty accompanying the larger set size would be expected generally to elevate the size of congruity and task effects across dimensions, in line with results from the present study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Uncertainty mechanisms of this type may also be the source of the relations between Stroop facilitation and Stroop interference observed in the filtering task. The disparity between facilitation and interference was greatest when set size was largest, that is, when the uncertainty of classification was greatest. Moreover, disparity correlated almost perfectly with average Garner interference across dimensions, a measure of global selection failure. Conversely, disparity generally was unrelated to asymmetric failures, which were controlled by contexts unrelated to stimulus probability. These results indicate that facilitation and interference are not well explained by the asymmetric intrusiveness of words on color classification (e.g., through the automatic activation of words). Rather, the relations between facilitation and interference in the filtering task appear to originate in the uncertainty of classification, which, as we have suggested, may generate global selection failures by undermining either the activation of target representations or the suppression of distractor representations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What about the effects of covariate context? Stimulus uncertainty was equally low in our positive and negative covariate contexts, and yet global selection failure was significantly greater in the positive context; that is, in correlated tasks, Stroop facilitation significantly outweighed Stroop interference. To explain this result, we must consider a dual role for negative redundancy: When two dimensions are correlated negatively, the stimulus combination is certain, but the decisional information is not. Indeed, on each trial of this task, the distractor's value provided consistent information encouraging the incorrect identity of the target. Because relatively less selection failure was evident in the negative covariate context, one conclusion is that participants did not readily seek out the redundant information contained in negatively correlated contexts because they learned quickly that this redundancy was offset by conflicting decisional information that could only harm their classification speed and accuracy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The positive context, in contrast, entailed a different classification situation. Here, global Stroop facilitation may have originated in participants' active efforts to seek out the blend of redundant stimulus information and congruent decisional information this context afforded. Furthermore, the fact that a main effect of covariate context was obtained only for global failure, and not for asymmetric failure, suggests that differences in the use of redundancy between contexts applied equally to classification of colors or words. Nevertheless, in actively implementing the commingled stimulus and decisional certainty of the positive context, our participants appeared to be sensitive to the relative discriminability of the dimensions, which is why asymmetric failure in the positive context shifted monotonically in sign across experiments. In general, the effects of covariate context demonstrate the proficiency of perceivers in maximizing the environmental information available to them in different classification situations. In the case of positive covariate context, such facility led to striking interactions between the exogenous information extracted from the covariate context and the endogenous memories tapped by the psychophysical and production contexts. The form of these interactions implies that, in reaching classification judgments, perceivers behave optimally in integrating the trial-to-trial uncertainty of the stimuli, established through the covariate context and the set size context, with the processing imbalance between the stimulus dimensions, established by psychophysical context and production context.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EAACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> depicts a simplified summary of the proposed basis of congruity effects and task effects in Stroop classification.

The greater the imbalance favoring one dimension (e.g., word), the greater the asymmetric failure of selection experienced on the other dimension (e.g., color). Set size context and covariate context affect the derived probabilistic relations of either the individual stimulus values within a dimension or the combinations of stimulus values between dimensions. These two contexts thereby determine stimulus uncertainty, the degree of informativeness supplied by each stimulus, updated by perceivers on a trial-by-trial basis.

We believe, however, that both factors are fundamental in understanding behavioral outcomes in Stroop classification. Indeed, we claim that the set of contexts that <a href="#c80">Stroop (1935)</a> used in his own study exaggerated both stimulus–decisional uncertainty and a processing imbalance between the dimensions. Stroop tested a relatively large set of (20) stimuli in a task that correlated the dimensions negatively. Such an arrangement would undoubtedly have caused participants a great deal of stimulus and decisional uncertainty in identifying each item. Stroop used an oral response mode to highly legible stimuli. Such a setup would alone account for the large imbalance in discriminability that he found, which favored the baseline discrimination of words over colors and which, as we have seen, fosters asymmetries in selective attention failure. Importantly, the vast majority of recent Stroop studies (see <a href="#c45">MacLeod, 1991</a>) have followed Stroop's lead, testing only imbalanced dimensions (i.e., words are more discriminable than colors) and only correlated conditions (i.e., the conditional probability of a word given its matching color is higher than that for any other combination of word and color).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In view of the results from the present study, it is no surprise, therefore, that participants in Stroop's (and other) studies displayed such enormous disruption from words when naming colors: The psychophysical, production, set size, and covariate contexts all converged to undermine their selective attention performance, with the psychophysical and production contexts each contributing to an asymmetric selection failure and the set size and covariate contexts each contributing to a global selection failure. The present research has shown that by judicious selection of each of these contexts, the magnitude, the direction, and even the presence of congruity effects and task effects can be predictably fabricated. We conclude that the sources of these contextual effects were two separate attentional mechanisms, one devoted to determining the degree of dimensional imbalance and the other to deriving the stimulus and decisional uncertainty within each task.</p><a id="xhp-27-3-515-ID0EAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_186" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn1">1</a></sup> In this article, the term <em>selective attention failure</em> refers to any evidence indicating an influence of distractors on behavioral responses to targets. Thus, failure is defined in terms of the participants' explicit task instructions to attend only to the criterial dimension and to ignore the irrelevant dimension. In certain conditions, such as those involving a correlation between values on two dimensions, a conflict may arise between the task instructions and the participants' task goals because, under these conditions, paying attention to the irrelevant dimension may ultimately enhance task performance (e.g., by producing redundancy gains). Indeed, in these situations, an ideal observer (i.e., in statistical decision theory; see <a href="#c30">Green &amp; Swets, 1966</a>; <a href="#c57">Melara, Marks, &amp; Potts, 1993a</a>) could optimize performance only by disregarding the task instructions. Our use of the term <em>failure</em> in these and other circumstances emphasizes the degree of influence (either global or asymmetrical) that the distractor exerted on classification decisions about the target.
