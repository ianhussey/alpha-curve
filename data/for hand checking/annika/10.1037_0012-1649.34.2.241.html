I am grateful to Tomoko Fukui and Keiko Kawashima for their assistance with the collection of data. I am also greatly indebted to Janet F.

Thanks also to Susan Goldin-Meadow for meticulously reading the manuscript and correcting the English.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is well known that when speaking to young children and infants, adults (particularly mothers) modify certain linguistic and prosodic aspects of their speech in distinctive ways. Typically, adults tend to use short, simple sentences, with much repetition and redundancy (<a href="#c16">Snow, 1972</a>; <a href="#c17">Snow &amp; Ferguson, 1977</a>). In terms of the prosodic features of their speech, the utterances become higher pitched, with wider pitch excursions and with exaggerated pitch contours (<a href="#c9">Garnica, 1977</a>; <a href="#c18">Stern, 1977</a>; <a href="#c11">Masataka 1992b</a>). Interest in the structure and the function of this specialized form of child-directed speech known as <em>motherese</em> stems from the possibility that such speech may enhance the young child's language learning. Indeed, several recent experimental studies have shown that the salience of motherese for the preverbal infant results both from the infant's attentional responsiveness to certain sounds more than others and from the infant's selective affective responsiveness to certain attributes of auditory signals. For example, using a conditional head-turning procedure, <a href="#c6">Fernald (1985</a>) showed that 4-month-old infants turned their heads more frequently in the direction necessary to activate a recording of female infant-directed speech than in that necessary to activate one of female adult-directed speech. <a href="#c20">Werker and McLeod (1989</a>) reported that both 4- to 5-month-old and 7- to 9-month-old infants who were watching videotapes of a woman talking to an infant and talking to an adult demonstrated more positive affect while watching the infant-directed tape. Apparently, the infants found infant-directed speech more attractive than adult-directed speech. Results of these studies indicate that infants are attentionally and affectively more responsive, and perhaps show more readiness for social engagement, when listening to infant-directed speech than when listening to adult-directed speech.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moreover, the characteristics associated with motherese may be modality-free properties. In both American Sign Language (ASL; <a href="#c5">Erting, Prezioso, &amp; O'Grandy Hynes, 1990</a>) and Japanese Sign Language (JSL; <a href="#c10">Masataka, 1992</a>a), it was found that when communicating with their deaf infants, deaf mothers used signs at a significantly slower tempo than when communicating with their deaf adult friends. They tended to repeat the same sign frequently by producing multiple tokens, and the movements associated with each sign were somewhat exaggerated. Sign motherese could parallel speech motherese in that prosodic patterns of the signal appear to be varied in both registers. Duration, scope, and repetition are all regarded to be dimensions of prosody in JSL and ASL (<a href="#c19">Stokoe, 1960</a>), roughly analogous to duration, pitch, and repetition in speech.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Indeed, infants with sign input are somehow tuned to the particular properties of sign motherese, just as hearing infants are so tuned to the properties of spoken motherese. In my recent study (<a href="#c12">Masataka, 1996</a>), the videotapes of deaf mothers communicating in JSL with their deaf infants or with their adult friends were presented to 12 six-month-old congenitally deaf infants. The mothers filmed in the videotapes were totally unfamiliar to the infants. To develop the tape, 5 mothers were asked to recite identical scripts either toward their infants or toward their deaf friends. When later presented to the 12 infants, these stimulus tapes elicited greater attentional and affective responsiveness in infants who watched the infant-directed sign than in infants who watched adult-directed sign.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Together, the available data indicate that motherese is a prevalent form of language input to infants in speech or in sign and that it serves important social and attentional features in early development. This fact has led several researchers to explore the possibility that the effectiveness of exaggerated properties in motherese in modulating infant attentional and affective responsiveness results from innate predispositions to respond selectively to the properties. Concerning speech motherese, <a href="#c2">Cooper and Aslin (1990</a>) showed that an infant's preference for exaggerated prosodic features is present when tested at the age of 2 days. From the results, it appears that postnatal experience with language does not have to be extensive for the infant to learn about the prosodic features of their native language. However, it has been shown that newborns still prefer the intonational contour and temporal patterning of a prenatally experienced melody (<a href="#c14">Panneton, 1985</a>). Both prenatal and postnatal auditory experience affect the relative salience of prosodic cues for young infants. In a subsequent study, 4- and 9-month-old English-learning infants are reported to show a robust attentional and affective preference for infant-directed speech over adult-directed speech in Cantonese, though the language is completely “foreign” for them (<a href="#c21">Werker, Pegg, &amp; McLeod, 1994</a>), but these infants have heard speech before. As long as hearing infants are investigated, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to address the question of whether exposure to any language is necessary for the infant to be able to react to the motherese form of the language. The purpose of the following experiment was to determine whether hearing infants with no exposure to signed language also prefer sign motherese. If such a preference exists, then human infants lock in on particular kinds of patterned input in a language modality completely independent of prior experience.</p><a id="dev-34-2-241-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_13" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="dev-34-2-241-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Hearing mothers (<em>N</em> = 45) and their firstborn, full-term, hearing infants with no exposure to a signed language (21 boys and 24 girls) participated in this experiment. All of the infants were 6 months old, healthy and had uncomplicated prenatal and perinatal histories. Their mothers were all monolingual women who spoke only Japanese. They did not work outside the home, were between 22 and 29 years old, and were from middle-class backgrounds. Their husbands were also monolingual and spoke only Japanese. The participants were recruited for the study through an advertisement in a local newspaper, and they were contacted by phone. When first contacted, it was confirmed that their infants had not previously been exposed to any signed languages.</p><a id="dev-34-2-241-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Stimulus Tape</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The stimulus tape shown to each of the 45 infants was the same videotape used in my previous experiment with deaf infants (<a href="#c12">Masataka, 1996</a>). The edited tape was approximately 7 min long, comprising excerpts of the infant- and adult-directed sign by 5 deaf mothers (a total of 10 episodes). All of the 5 women, whose husbands were also deaf, were signers of JSL as their first language. Each of the mothers was taped when reciting the following same seven sentences in JSL either toward their 6-month-old congenitally deaf infant or toward their deaf adult friend: “Good morning. How are you today? Get up. Come on, now. If you get up right away, we have a whole hour to go for a walk. What do you want to do? Let's go for a walk.” Each mother brought her friend with her to the laboratory to develop the stimulus. The script was nearly a direct translation from that used in <a href="#c20">Werker and McLeod (1989</a>). This passage was presented to the mothers in written Japanese. As every sentence in the passage was syntactically uncomplicated, the mothers did not differ appreciably in how they translated it into JSL. An example of the signed sentences used in the experiment is presented in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. Video recordings were conducted with each mother and her infant or friend, respectively, seated in chairs in a face-to-face position in a sound-attenuating chamber (12.5 m × 8.5 m × 3.2 m). The height of each chair was adjusted so that the eyes of the mothers, their infants, and their friends were approximately 95 cm above ground level. The distance between the chairs was 135 cm. To develop the stimulus, the entire figures of the mothers were monitored by a video camera that was placed just behind and beyond the infants or the friends (10 cm behind and 110 cm above ground level), and all of the signs produced by them were recorded.<br /><br /><a id="fig1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/81d013c92a1c56d0f459c36ec2485cad/571c1582/pdh/dev/dev-34-2-241-fig1a.gif" alt="dev-34-2-241-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

The sentence meaning “What do you want to do?” in signs of Japanese Sign Language</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the mothers were notified that their interactive behavior with various communicative partners was of interest, they were not told specifically that signed language was to be under analysis. When the recording started, each of them was instructed to interact with their infant or friend as she normally might do when they were alone. After this instruction was provided, the pair was left alone in the chamber for the duration of the recording. Use of toys or other instruments was not allowed for the mother to draw the attention of her infant. She was told not to move her head throughout the entire video-recording period. This procedure was executed to examine behavioral differences between infant-directed signing and adult-directed signing. Unlike ASL, JSL does not rely on cues produced by head movement from a grammatical perspective (<a href="#c15">Shinoda, 1985</a>). For example, even questions in JSL require the use of a manual question sign, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Signing by each of the five mothers was also recorded by two other video cameras to develop the stimulus tape. One of them monitored the plane view of the mother, and the other monitored her side view. The framing rate for this filming was 50 frames per second. Watching images provided by these two cameras, two raters measured duration (number of frames) of each recognized sign. Moreover, on the basis of the image provided by the camera monitoring the plane view of the mother, the position of the right hand in relation to the head (angle subtended by the right hand with respect to the sagittal plane) was quantitatively measured by estimating the mean value of this angle for each sign. Similarly, watching the image of the side view of the mother frame by frame, the raters computed the average angle subtended by the right elbow, with respect to the vertical axis for each sign, to note the spatial relation of the elbow to the head. These measurements were performed to analyze the degree of exaggeration of signing by the mother when interacting with her infant as compared to her adult friend. In addition, whenever the mother repeated the same sign consecutively, it was counted by the raters. Repetition in the stimulus tape was defined as recording of multiple tokens of the same sign.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When values scored in this manner were averaged across mothers for each condition (infant or adult friend), it was found that they produced signs at a significantly slower tempo when communicating with their infants than when communicating with their friends. They tended to repeat the same sign often, and the movements associated with each sign were somewhat exaggerated in the infant condition (<a href="#c12">Masataka, 1996</a>). These characteristics were considered to be a visual analogue to the characteristics of speech motherese in which mothers speak to their infants with slower tempo, with much repetition, and with more exaggerated pitch excursions or pitch contours (<a href="#c10">Masataka, 1992</a>b).</p><a id="dev-34-2-241-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present experiment, stimulus presentation and recording of the participants’ responses were undertaken according to the same procedure as used in <a href="#c12">Masataka's (1996</a>) study. The study took place in a 2.5-m × 3.2-m black booth with a few pictures on the walls. Each of the 45 infants received the stimulus presentation only once throughout the experiment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">During each session, the mother was instructed to stand with her back to a video monitor (Sony KX-2006) mounted in the front panel of the booth, which was connected to a videotape recorder (Sony SC 2500) on which the stimulus was presented. She was told to hold the infant over her shoulder so that the infant could face the video display at a distance of approximately 60 cm. During the session, the mother was asked to direct her gaze to a picture on the wall 90 deg to her right, with a music-delivering headphone placed on her head. To equate conditions between the studies, even the deaf mothers were asked to wear the headphone in <a href="#c12">Masataka's (1996</a>) study. The infant's responses were recorded with a low-light video camera (Sony TR-1) that was placed directly over the stimulus-presenting monitor. The camera was connected to a second monitor placed in an adjacent room and was recorded by a second videotape recorder placed in the same room. An experimenter remained there, monitored the participant through the video system, and ensured that the infant remained on screen and in focus during filming and video presentation. Video presentation was undertaken only when the infant was regarded to be in a quiet and alert state.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The infant's responses to the stimulus presentations were evaluated by four highly trained coders. The coding schema was essentially the same as that used in <a href="#c20">Werker and McLeod (1989</a>). The coders watched the videotapes filming the infant's reactions and were not aware of the stimulus in the condition (infant-directed or adult-directed sign). Two of the raters scored the attentional responsiveness of the infant to the video presentation. These two watched the infant on the screen independently and pushed a button whenever the infant fixated on the video display. These button presses were counted and timed by a personal computer (NEC 9800). The percentage of the total video display time spent looking at the video screen for a given infant was computed by each of the raters, and the score was subsequently averaged between them. To establish reliability check, cases in which one rater recorded the onset as well as the offset of an infant's fixation within 1 s of that recorded by a second independent rater were considered agreements. Overall interrater agreement was 98%. Mean interrater time errors in judgments of onsets and offsets of the infant's fixation acts were 0.3 s and 0.4 s, respectively.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To obtain a measure of affective responsiveness, the other two observers were told independently to attend to facial features as well as vocalizations of each infant and answer three questions about the infant in each condition, using a set of 9-point scales. Each of the questions represents the following three different dimensions: Question A: “How much do you think the infant was trying to communicate?” (communicative intent), Question B: “How interested do you feel the infant was?” (social favorability), and Question C: “What is your feeling about the infant's emotional state?” (emotionality). Each of these 9-point scales had specific anchor points. For the first two questions, the scale ranged from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 9 (<em>totally</em>); for Question C, the range was from 1 (<em>experiencing negative or unpleasant feeling</em>) to 9 (<em>experiencing positive or pleasant feeling</em>). Cases in which the rating of the infant by one rater was in agreement with that of a second independent rater within a 1-point difference were considered agreements. Overall reliability was found to be 89%.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Examination of the reliability of the rating scale composite was conducted with <a href="#c3">Cronbach, Gleser, Nanda, and Rajaratnam's (1972</a>) generalizability procedures. In computing the generalizability coefficients, according to this procedure, judgments were found to be reliable both among scales (<em>G</em> = .93) and among raters (<em>G</em> = .90). The results allowed the three dimensions to be treated as indexes of a single underlying factor. Thus, one cumulative score of affective responsiveness was created for each infant by summing ratings on the three dimensions by each rater and by averaging between the two raters. Consequently, the maximum and the minimum cumulative scores would be 27 and 3, respectively, for each infant for each stimulus condition. The higher the scores the infants received, the more positive emotions they were judged to be experiencing.</p><a id="dev-34-2-241-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_32" title="Results">Results</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> presents detailed individual data on infant responsiveness to infant-directed signing versus adult-directed signing.

The continuous, analogue properties of space and movement are used in systematic, rule-governed ways in almost all signed languages that have been investigated so far (<a href="#c1">Armstrong, Stokoe, &amp; Wilcox, 1995</a>; <a href="#c13">Newport, 1981</a>). Japanese Sign Language is not an exception. These abstract spatial and movement units are analogous in function to discrete morphemes found in spoken languages. Thus, manipulation of duration, scope, and repetition rate of sign corresponds to prosodic modification in speech. Deaf mothers who have acquired a signed language as a first language modify this prosodic dimension of the signed language when interacting with their deaf infants, just as hearing mothers alter the prosodic characteristics of their speech when speaking to their hearing infants (<a href="#c5">Erting et al., 1990</a>; <a href="#c10">Masataka, 1992</a>a). Moreover, 6-month-old deaf infants show stronger attentional and affective responsiveness when watching infant-directed signing than when watching adult-directed signing (<a href="#c12">Masataka, 1996</a>), just as hearing infants do when listening to infant-directed versus adult-directed speech (<a href="#c20">Werker &amp; McLeod, 1989</a>). Characteristics of speech perception found in preverbal hearing infants may be comparable to those of sign perception in deaf infants during the same period. It is hypothesized to be the grand sweeps in changes in fundamental frequency (dynamic peak-to-peak changes) that attract hearing infants to spoken motherese (<a href="#c7">Fernald, 1989</a>; <a href="#c8">Fernald &amp; Simon, 1984</a>). As a visual analogue to such features, it is likely to be the sweeps of peak visual movement in sign motherese that attract deaf infants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results of the present experiment extend this phenomenon by demonstrating that hearing infants who have had no exposure to any form of signed language are attracted to motherese in JSL in a manner strikingly similar to that of deaf infants who have been exposed to JSL from birth. Infants are attracted to sign motherese, regardless of whether they have ever seen sign language. These results support the claim (<a href="#c2">Cooper &amp; Aslin, 1990</a>; <a href="#c21">Werker et al., 1994)</a> that the special properties evident in infant-directed communication may have universal attentional and affective significance. Indeed, the present data are a much more powerful demonstration that motherese attracts infants’ attention, independent of prior experience, because the hearing infants that participated in the present experiment had never seen any signed language before, let alone sign motherese. Findings of this sort may be obtained only with hearing infants of deaf parents, who would not have been exposed to speech in utero. All hearing infants of hearing parents are exposed to some form of speech as early as the prenatal period (<a href="#c4">DeCasper, Lecanuet, Busnel, Granier-Deferre, &amp; Maugeais, 1994</a>). The present finding indicates that human infants are predisposed to attend to motherese even if they have had no exposure to it before. This is precisely the property that motherese needs to successfully draw infant attention to vital linguistic signals.</p><a id="dev-34-2-241-ID0EVABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_43" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Armstrong, D.
