Santor</strong><br /><em>Department of Psychology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada</em>;<br /><strong>James C. Coyne</strong><br /><em>Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania Health System</em></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Acknowledgement: </strong>This work was supported in part by a National Institute of Mental Health Grant MH 52129-06 and a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Grant.<br /><br />We are grateful to Lindsay Hawker for her assistance in preparing the manuscript.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One of the most long-running controversies in the literature on depression concerns whether depression should be viewed as a distinct diagnostic category or as a single continuum occurring in normal and clinically diagnosed individuals (<a href="#c4">Coyne, 1994</a>; <a href="#c9">Flett, Vredenburg, &amp; Krames, 1997</a>; <a href="#c13">Kendall &amp; Flannery-Shroeder, 1995</a>; <a href="#c14">Kendall, Hollon, Beck, Hammen, &amp; Ingram, 1993</a>; <a href="#c28">Tennen, Hall, &amp; Affleck, 1995a</a>, <a href="#c30">1995b</a>; <a href="#c31">Vredenburg, Flett, &amp; Krames, 1993</a>; <a href="#c32">Weary, Edwards, &amp; Jacobson, 1995</a>). One aspect of this controversy, the issue of correspondence between self-report measures and a clinical diagnosis, has largely been settled. Most adults who have been designated as depressed on the basis of self-report measures are not clinically depressed. Generally only one third or fewer meet standard diagnostic criteria for major depression (<a href="#c3">Coulehan, Schulberg, &amp; Block, 1989</a>; <a href="#c8">Fechner-Bates, Coyne, &amp; Schwenk, 1994</a>; <a href="#c16">Myers &amp; Weissman, 1980</a>), and the correspondence between self-report and clinical diagnosis in younger persons is even lower (<a href="#c21">Roberts, Lewinsohn, &amp; Seeley, 1991</a>). Moreover, most distressed persons do not report sustained depressed mood or anhedonia in semistructured interviews (<a href="#c6">Coyne &amp; Schwenk, 1997</a>). Even with raised cutoff scores and sophisticated psychometric analyses designed to identify and optimally combine only the most effective items, limitations of self-report measures like the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; <a href="#c18">Radloff, 1977</a>) persist (<a href="#c22">Santor &amp; Coyne, 1997</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Evaluating the correspondence between self-report measures of depression and diagnoses of depression is only one issue to consider in determining whether clinically diagnosed depression is best considered a discrete diagnostic category or on a continuum with depressive symptoms experienced by most individuals. An important consideration in addressing this question is whether clinically depressed and nondepressed individuals express individual symptoms differently at similar levels of overall depressive severity.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_11" title="A Strategy for Evaluating Differences Between Clinical and Nonclinical Samples">A Strategy for Evaluating Differences Between Clinical and Nonclinical Samples</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Viewing depression as a continuum implies that scores on measures of severity of depression are sufficient to fully characterize differences among individuals, irrespective of diagnostic status, and that similar scores obtained from clinically depressed and nondepressed individuals warrant the same interpretation. Resolution of these issues must start with some way of distinguishing differences in symptom expression from differences in symptom severity. Differences in symptom severity are to be anticipated between groups of nondepressed and depressed individuals; however, differences in the probability that specific symptoms are expressed can only be examined after equating individuals in terms of the overall severity of their symptoms. If specific symptoms differ in the likelihood of being expressed in groups of depressed and nondepressed individuals who have been equated in terms of symptom severity, then it can be argued that these groups differ in some other, potentially important ways. Findings of this kind imply that a simple dimension of severity is inadequate to distinguish these groups. Such findings would also argue against viewing depression as a continuum and could add to the impetus for exploration of qualitative differences between nondepressed and depressed individuals, which cannot be ordered along a simple continuum.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Differentiating the degree to which individual symptoms are expressed from overall symptom severity can be operationalized as the ability to detect bias or differential item functioning (DIF), a task for which well-developed analytic techniques exist (<a href="#c15">Lord, 1980</a>; <a href="#c24">Santor, Ramsay, &amp; Zuroff, 1994</a>; <a href="#c23">Santor &amp; Ramsay, 1998</a>; <a href="#c30">Thissen, Steinberg, &amp; Gerrard, 1986</a>). Bias or DIF is observed when there is a “systematic deviation from an expected value” (<a href="#c33">Widiger &amp; Spitzer, 1991</a>, p. 2) for the performance of an item that is presumed to reflect a particular symptom and its associated response options. If no DIF exists, then individuals who obtain similar scores on a measure of depression should on average be equally likely to express specific symptoms of depression as represented by the items and the response options associated with them. However, if reliable differences on individual symptoms do emerge, this would suggest that groups are different in ways worthy of further exploration. However, detecting DIF depends on equating individuals along some continuum of severity. Considerable research has examined differences between depressed and nondepressed groups of individuals (see <a href="#c4">Coyne, 1994</a>, and <a href="#c9">Flett et al., 1997</a>, for contrasting assessments of this literature), yet very little research has differentiated mean group differences from DIF (cf. <a href="#c24">Santor et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#c30">Thissen et al., 1986</a>). We know of no study examining DIF in samples of nondepressed and clinically depressed individuals. As a result, direct evidence bearing on the continuity of depression at the symptom level, which accounts for quantitative differences between nondepressed and depressed individuals, has been unavailable to date.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_16" title="Assessing Depressive Symptoms">Assessing Depressive Symptoms</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Unlike many past studies comparing clinical and nonclinical groups of individuals, we relied on clinician ratings of symptoms in the present study rather than on self-report responses to examine differences between clinically depressed and nondepressed individuals. The use of interviews conducted by trained clinicians allowed for the meaning of symptoms to be clarified for respondents and their reports to be probed as well as for clinicians to come to independent judgments when the respondents' reports were obviously discrepant with their affect or demeanor. Research suggests that “compared with patients' self-ratings, clinicians' judgments more strongly reflect specific, clinically prominent symptoms (e.g., marked anhedonia and psychomotor retardation) and are less influenced by the patients' general level of affective distress,” although this difference is somewhat reduced when clinicians are not rating symptoms in the context of a diagnostic interview (<a href="#c2">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</a>, p. 327). Moreover, a number of items on self-report measures, such as the CES-D (e.g., People were unfriendly; I felt fearful) have little relevance to a clinical diagnosis of depression (<a href="#c22">Santor &amp; Coyne, 1997</a>). Accordingly, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD; <a href="#c11">Hamilton, 1960</a>) was used to rate these symptoms and to come to an overall severity score based on their number and intensity.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_20" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nondepressed Sample</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The sample of nondepressed individuals was drawn from the Michigan Depression Project (<a href="#c8">Fechner-Bates et al., 1994</a>), which examined depressive disorders in primary care and psychiatric patients.

Potential participants for the study were initially screened with the CES-D (<a href="#c18">Radloff, 1977</a>), and a proportion of both distressed and nondistressed individuals completed a psychiatric interview, which included the Structured Interview for the <em>DSM-III-R</em> (SCID; <a href="#c27">Spitzer, Williams, Gibbon, &amp; First, 1990</a>) and the HRSD (<a href="#c11">Hamilton, 1960</a>).

Two thirds of these 316 patients scored in the distressed range, defined by the standard cutoff score of 16 or more (<a href="#c18">Radloff, 1977</a>), and one third was in the nondistressed range. Of the 316 persons with complete data, 67 met criteria for a mood disorder and 249 did not. None of these 316 individuals met criteria for a psychotic disorder. Those with comorbid anxiety or somatic symptoms were subsequently deleted in supplementary analyses.

Administration of the SCID was audiotaped with the patients' consent, and a subset of 10 tapes for each of 6 interviewers was rerated by a clinical psychologist to determine the reliability of interviewer judgments.

Items on the HRSD consist of groups of graded statements (i.e., options) reflecting increasing degrees of severity corresponding primarily to somatic and vegetative symptoms of depression, with a few items assessing cognitive symptoms, such as guilt. The HRSD was initially designed as a clinician-rated measure of depression intended to be used as an index of severity with individuals already diagnosed with depression. The HRSD has been used in hundreds of studies and research protocols, particularly with inpatients and drug outcome studies. The original version of the HRSD consisted of 17 items; however, a 21-item version of the scale was subsequently developed that assessed other nondepressive symptoms such as obsessiveness and paranoia. Master's level interviewers for the Michigan Depression Project received extensive training with the use of HRSD. The interrater correlation coefficient (ICC) for HRSD scores was determined through a rescoring of audiotapes and was found to be .89.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Analytic Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We used nonparametric kernel-smoothing techniques and software (TESTGRAF<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup>) developed by <a href="#c19">Ramsay (1991</a>, <a href="#c20">1993)</a> to estimate option characteristic curves, which served as a measure of item and option effectiveness. These techniques have been used previously to examine the psychometric properties of self-report scales and to evaluate differential item functioning (<a href="#c24">Santor et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#c25">Santor, Zuroff, Ramsay, Cervantes, &amp; Palacios, 1995</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Techniques based on item response theory are not only helpful in addressing these issues; they are crucial to evaluating these issues adequately. Response characteristic curves describe the relation between endorsing an option and some other variable or dimension of variation (<em>q</em>) such as depressive severity. For options from specific items, the response or option characteristic curve is defined as <em>P</em><em>jm</em> (<em>q</em>), the probability of endorsing option <em>m</em> of item <em>j</em> at some point (<em>q</em>) on a continuum (θ), which in this instance is symptom severity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The TESTGRAF program begins by ranking individuals according to some statistic, usually total score. Rank values are then converted to standard normal scores. A set of 32 equally spaced evaluation points (<em>q</em>) was selected from the larger distribution of standard normal scores (i.e., −3, −2, −1, … , +1, +2, +3) at which the values of the option characteristic curves will be estimated. Option characteristic curves were then estimated at these different evaluation points (<em>q</em>) using a nonparametric smoothing kernel (<a href="#c19">Ramsay, 1991</a>, <a href="#c20">1993</a>). <em>P</em><em>jm</em> (<em>q</em>) is the probability of endorsing option <em>m</em> of item <em>j</em> at some point (<em>q</em>) on a continuum of depressive severity expressed as standard normal quantiles.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Kernel smoothing refers to an entire class of techniques; a Gaussian kernel was used in the present study. Techniques based on smoothing kernels implement the principle of local averaging to estimate the relation between one variable and another, such as (a) whether an option from an item was endorsed by a clinician within (b) different regions of depressive severity. Values close to evaluation points are weighted more heavily than were other data points. As a result, nonparametric smoothing kernels are extremely flexible and will generally achieve a better degree of fit to the data than parametric models do, particularly when the data are not linear, are not monotonically increasing, or are expected to change rapidly with changes in depressive severity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finding a DIF-free, unidimensional statistic along which individuals from both depressed and nondepressed samples can be equated is crucial. Otherwise, any statistic used to rank order individuals will reflect differential item functioning present in scale items showing DIF. Although the HRSD is the most widely used clinician rating scale for depression outcome studies, psychometric analyses conducted by Gibbons and his colleagues have questioned the utility of the HRSD as a unidimensional index of severity (<a href="#c10">Gibbons, Clark, &amp; Kupfer, 1993</a>). This is not surprising given the heterogeneity of symptoms on the HRSD. Because the HRSD is multidimensional, responses to items are likely to be determined by a number of factors, making it difficult to compare individuals in any straightforward way. However, Gibbons and his colleagues did acknowledge that some of the items on the HRSD might form a “viable candidate for a unidimensional index of global depression severity” (<a href="#c10">Gibbons et al., 1993</a>, p. 269), which formed the basis of current analyses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given the importance of equating individuals along a single continuum of depressive severity for the present analyses, we constructed a unidimensional index of severity using only those items on the HRSD that were (a) consistent with formal diagnostic criteria for depression and (b) could be combined to form a unidimensional index of global depression severity, as suggested by <a href="#c10">Gibbons et al. (1993)</a>. We conducted a principal components analysis to identify items that loaded greater than 0.30 on the first rotated principal component to identify items that could form a unidimensional index of depressive severity. Several items on the HRSD assess symptoms of anxiety, which if used to equate formally depressed and nondepressed individuals might produce spurious findings. Accordingly, these items were dropped. The remaining items included depressed mood (Item 1), guilt (Item 2), suicide (Item 3), anhedonia/work impairment (Item 4), weight loss (Item 5), early insomnia (Item 6), middle insomnia (Item 7), and late insomnia (Item 8), psychomotor agitation (Item 14), psychomotor retardation (Item 15), and loss of libido (Item 17). These items are consistent with the results of Gibbons et al.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We then used this 11-item index to identify differential item functioning in any of the items from the HRSD. Items from the 11-item unidimensional scale showing DIF were subsequently removed to produce an index of depressive severity that itself did not contain any differential item functioning. Items demonstrating DIF were identified on the basis of whether items contained option characteristic curves from the depressed group that fell within the 95% confidence intervals of curves for the nondepressed group. Items showing DIF were deleted. On this basis, we deleted Items 1, 3, 4, and 7 from the initial pool of 11 items, producing a 7-item DIF-free index, which was then used as the continuum against which individual items and options were examined. Even though this DIF-free index was based on relatively few items, scores on the 7-item DIF-free severity index correlated well with the original 17-item HRSD scale. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the 7-item index and the overall 17-item scale was high (0.95), indicating that the full-scale and shorter unidimensional, DIF-free scale were measuring depressive severity in a similar way. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the outstanding 10 items and the overall 7-item DIF-free index was also high (0.77). Given the strong correlation between the 7-item unidimensional DIF-free scale and the 17-item composite score, we also display the 17-item total score on subsequent plots for illustrative purposes. Option characteristic curves estimated on the basis of the 7-item DIF-free measure and the full 17-item scale were similar.<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We then computed symptom severity scores for both depressed and nondepressed individuals with a maximum likelihood algorithm using the values of option characteristic curves from items showing little or no DIF.

Finally, we examined differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals on all 21 items from the HRSD by plotting option characteristic curves as a function of the derived DIF-free index of depressive severity. This method of creating a DIF-free index of depressive severity is important to ensure that differential item functioning does not adversely affect the manner in which individuals are equated.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overview</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, our method involved identifying a unidimensional scale of 11 items from the HRSD that assesses depressive severity, from which we removed 4 items to produce a DIF-free scale along which depressed and nondepressed individuals could be equated.

Clinicians were more likely to observe “no symptoms” (Option 0) in depressed adults than in nondepressed adults at most levels of symptom severity, whereas most other aspects of hypochondriacal symptomatology were more likely to be observed in nondepressed individuals at all levels of symptom severity. “Self-absorption (bodily) sensation” (Option 1); “preoccupation with health” (Option 2); and “frequent complaints, requests for help, etc.” (Option 3) were somewhat more likely to be observed in nondepressed individuals than in depressed adults, at most levels of symptom severity; however, these differences were nominal. Ninety-five percent confidence regions suggest that these differences are significant and robust only in Options 0 and 3. No differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals at any level of severity were observed on “hypochondriacal delusions” (Option 4), which was not endorsed by any individual in either sample and is not presented in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, option characteristic curves in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> show that the extent to which some features of middle insomnia (Item 7) were expressed differs in depressed and nondepressed individuals, equated in terms of overall symptom severity. Clinicians were more likely to observe “no difficulty” (Option 0) in depressed adults than in nondepressed adults at mild-to-moderate levels of symptom severity, but were more likely to observe “complaints of being restless and disturbed during the night” (Option 1) and “waking up during the night” (Option 2) in nondepressed than in depressed individuals, equated in terms of depressive severity.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EABCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Supplementary Analyses</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several items on the HRSD, such as insomnia and hypochondriasis, are not specific to depression, and may be more likely to be expressed by depressed individuals with comorbid anxiety conditions. To examine the impact of comorbid anxiety conditions, we reanalyzed these data, excluding any depressed or nondepressed individuals with primary or comorbid panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia), generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, agoraphobia, or somatoform disorder. Sample sizes for these supplementary analyses consisted of 231 nondepressed individuals and 461 depressed individuals. Results of these analyses showed no substantive change in the pattern of results for any of the items described in detail. Absolute differences between option characteristic curves for the full and reduced samples in no instance exceeded 0.04 at any evaluation point. Moreover, options showing DIF (defined on the basis of confidence regions) continued to show DIF in the reduced samples. Options that did not show DIF in the full sample did not show DIF in the reduced sample.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_71" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the degree to which depressed and nondepressed individuals express depressive symptoms differs, once individuals have been equated in terms of overall severity. Results showed that substantial differences emerged between depressed and nondepressed individuals on a number of key symptoms, including depressed mood, anhedonia, suicidality, middle insomnia, and hypochondriasis, even after equating individuals in terms of overall severity. Features of depressed mood, anhedonia, and suicidality were more likely to be expressed in depressed individuals than in nondepressed individuals with similar levels of symptom severity, whereas hypochondriasis and middle insomnia were more likely to be expressed in nondepressed individuals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At first glance, this may sound neither surprising nor important. So much can be concluded simply from examining group mean differences. However, these findings reveal more than a mere difference between groups. Option characteristic curves showed that there were differences in the likelihood with which some symptoms of depression were expressed in depressed and nondepressed individuals, even after equating them in terms of symptom severity. If the underlying continuum of severity is not sufficient to explain the probability of a symptom being expressed, then it follows that severity scores on the HRSD have different meanings in clinically depressed and nondepressed groups. We believe this weakens the argument for viewing depression as a continuum and challenges the viability of using high-scoring distressed individuals as “analog” depressed persons.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals were observed on some but not all symptoms. Symptoms that were more likely to be observed in depressed individuals included core symptoms of depression, such as depressed mood, anhedonia, and, impairment in work and activity. Symptoms that were more likely to be observed in nondepressed persons included hypochondriacal symptoms and middle insomnia. Results are consistent with a growing number of studies suggesting that depressed mood and the patterning of associated symptoms may be fundamentally different in depressed samples and nondepressed samples (<a href="#c5">Coyne, Fechner-Bates, &amp; Schwenk, 1994</a>; <a href="#c12">Katon &amp; Schulberg, 1992</a>; <a href="#c26">Sireling, Paykel, Freeling, Rao, &amp; Patel, 1985</a>). Differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals are not reducible to the severity of symptoms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results of this study also carry important implications for recent work that addresses the debate surrounding the continuity of depression. Flett and his colleagues (<a href="#c9">Flett et al., 1997</a>) have argued that depression is best viewed as a continuum, meaning that the characteristics and symptoms of depression differ only in degree, not in kind. Evidence for continuity was assessed in a number of areas, including what Flett and his colleagues defined as phenomenological continuity, which is based on the assumption that “symptoms experienced in mildly or moderately dysphoric participants differ quantitatively but not qualitatively in intensity, persistence, and degree of impairment when comparisons are made with participants who meet threshold conditions” [for a diagnosis of depression] (<a href="#c9">Flett et al., 1997</a>, p. 398). Flett et al. concluded that “the bulk of evidence tends to favor the continuity position, but research on those who meet diagnostic criteria for depression suggests that some discontinuities exist at more severe levels of depression” (p. 401).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Flett and his colleagues were unclear on what exactly constitutes a qualitative difference. Results from the present study showed that similar scores on the HRSD have different implications in depressed and nondepressed individuals. Even after accounting for quantitative differences in symptom severity, some symptoms were more likely to be observed in depressed individuals than in nondepressed individuals. Accordingly, a simple continuum of severity is inadequate to account for differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results of the present study also have important practical implications for the assessment of depressed individuals and for our understanding of some symptoms of depression, such as suicide and middle insomnia. Results for suicidality (Item 3) suggest that the threshold at which suicidality appears in clinically depressed individuals may be lower than in nondepressed individuals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, findings from the present study support the use of methods that allow researchers to conduct fine-grained analyses. Techniques that are based on item response theory offer new insights into issues such as the continuity of depressive symptoms, largely because these approaches distinguish how items are endorsed from the underlying condition they measure (cf. <a href="#c15">Lord, 1980</a>). As a result, approaches based on item response theory are not only helpful, they may be essential to resolving these issues adequately (<a href="#c23">Santor &amp; Ramsay, 1998</a>).</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EBACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There are several concerns with these data. First, results are most relevant to differences between depressed outpatients and nondepressed community-residing adults and may not generalize to other nondepressed psychiatric populations or to other demographic groups such as elderly individuals or adolescents. We conducted a number of supplemental analyses to examine the impact of comorbid anxiety conditions in the depressed sample. Results from these analyses showed that the observed differences were robust and could not be attributed to the presence of individuals in the depressed sample who also met criteria for a comorbid anxiety condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, because depressed and nondepressed samples were rated by different groups of clinicians, it is possible that differences in the degree to which symptoms were expressed may be the result of clinicians perceiving symptoms differently in different samples. This is certainly a possibility. However, multiple raters were involved in assessing individuals in both samples, and raters in both samples were highly trained clinicians with considerable experience in assessing depression. Interrater reliability was high. Finally, it is difficult to argue that such a general bias could be present in just some symptoms of depression (i.e., those showing DIF), but not in others.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, differences between groups may also be related to the fact that the nondepressed sample was selected with the purpose of oversampling distressed but nondepressed individuals (<a href="#c5">Coyne, Fechner-Bates, &amp; Schwenk, 1994</a>). Individuals included in the study were drawn from an initial screening sample of almost 2,000 people who completed the CES-D. Accordingly, it is possible that in a more representative sample, results would be different at nominal levels of depressive severity. In the present study, the most robust findings were found in the moderately severe range of depressive severity. This reflects the fact that the greatest number of individuals who could be compared had moderate levels of depressive severity. Conclusions should therefore be limited to moderate levels of depressive severity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fourth, a further concern involves the possibility that observed differences may be the result of how the groups were defined; that is, it may be that selecting individuals on any set of depressive symptoms would subsequently show DIF on those symptoms on which individuals were selected. To examine this issue empirically, we artificially allocated individuals to two groups on the basis of scores from a randomly selected subset of items from the HRSD. We then examined differential item functioning after equating individuals from both groups on the basis of scores from selected items. Results showed empirically that DIF was not observed on any of the selected items on which groups were defined. Not only was there no more DIF on items used to define groups than those that were not, there was virtually no DIF present in any of the items at all.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, to address the concern that results may be due to study differences, we also examined differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals within the Michigan Depression Project data set. Results of the analyses produced findings similar to though not as robust as those reported on the basis of the combined sample. Further analyses within specific primary settings in the Michigan Depression Project were not possible given the small number of clinically depressed individuals identified in primary care.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EAACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The purpose of the present study was to examine differences in the extent to which depressed and nondepressed individuals express specific symptoms of depression, after equating individuals in terms of depressive severity. Despite the numerous studies that have examined differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals, few studies have explicitly differentiated the manner in which symptoms are expressed from the severity of symptoms experienced. Results showed that there are important differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals on some symptoms of depression, such as depressed mood, suicidality, anhedonia and work impairment, somatic anxiety, and hypochondriasis, even after accounting for differences in depressive severity. This argues against viewing depression as a simple continuum along which both depressed and nondepressed individuals can be characterized.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0EAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_90" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn1">1</a></sup> The TESTGRAF program (<a href="#c20">Ramsay, 1993</a>) may be obtained from J.

Given the assumption of item response models, that theta is unidimensional, we estimated option characteristic curves as a function of the unidimensional 7-item scale. However, we also computed option characteristic curves (OCCs) based on total scores for the 17-item scale. OCCs from both analyses differed by an average of 0.000 and a standard deviation of 0.049 in the clinical group and by an average of 0.000 and a standard deviation of 0.058 in the nonclinical group. Given the absence of differences between these estimates, we also present total scores on the various option and item plots for illustrative purposes.</p><a id="abn-110-2-216-ID0E0BB0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_96" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Beck, T.
