article was presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, New York, April 1996.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The purpose of the present investigation was twofold. One was to test predictions of the internal/external (I/E) frames of reference model (<a href="#c7">Marsh, 1986</a>) with subject-specific academic self-efficacy to help illuminate the difference between academic self-concept and self-efficacy formation. The other was to test underlying assumptions of the I/E model with frame-specific academic self-concepts. Specifically, the present study examined whether students' verbal and math self-concepts were indeed positively correlated after the external comparison and negatively correlated after the internal comparison as the I/E model predicates.</p><a id="edu-90-1-102-ID0EFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_10" title="I/E Frames of Reference Model of Academic Self-Concept">I/E Frames of Reference Model of Academic Self-Concept</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To date, many studies on the structure of academic self-concept have documented its multifaceted and hierarchical nature (e.g., <a href="#c10">Marsh, 1990c</a>; <a href="#c11">Marsh, Byrne, &amp; Shavelson, 1988</a>; <a href="#c12">Marsh &amp; Shavelson, 1985</a>; <a href="#c21">Vispoel, 1995</a>). Of particular interest has been the separation between verbal and math self-concepts. Unlike verbal and math achievements, which were almost always highly correlated, verbal and math self-concepts often displayed a nonsignificant or considerably weaker association (e.g., <a href="#c5">Byrne &amp; Shavelson, 1986</a>; <a href="#c11">Marsh et al., 1988</a>; <a href="#c12">Marsh &amp; Shavelson, 1985</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c7">Marsh (1986)</a>
proposed the I/E frames of reference model to explain this phenomenon. He argued that students gauge their academic self-concept by comparing their ability in the area to their peers' ability in the same area (i.e., external comparison) and to their own ability in the other area (i.e., internal comparison). When the two processes operate simultaneously, a negative correlation between verbal and math self-concepts from the internal comparison cancels out a positive correlation from the external comparison. Further, achievement in one area negatively influences self-concept in the other area because a high self-concept in a given area requires good skills in the area (i.e., favorable external comparison) that are better than skills in competing areas (i.e., favorable internal comparison).</p><a id="edu-90-1-102-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_15" title="Academic Self-Concept Versus Academic Self-Efficacy Formation">Academic Self-Concept Versus Academic Self-Efficacy Formation</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Social cognitive researchers argued that there is an important difference between self-concept and self-efficacy judgments. According to <a href="#c22">Zimmerman (1995)</a>, self-concept tends to emphasize normative assessment of ability (e.g., being better than others), whereas self-efficacy judgments stress mastery criteria (e.g., being able to succeed). The relativistic comparison processes prescribed by the I/E model, therefore, are expected to play only a limited role in self-efficacy formation. In fact, <a href="#c18">Skaalvik and Rankin (1990)</a>
found only partial support for the I/E model with measures of academic self-efficacy. A strong positive correlation (.65) was observed between verbal and math self-efficacy. Only verbal achievement yielded a significant negative effect (−.36) on math self-efficacy for girls. When <a href="#c13">Marsh, Walker, and Debus (1991)</a>
included both academic self-concept and self-efficacy in their study, all of the I/E model's predictions were confirmed with self-concept, whereas none of the predictions was upheld with self-efficacy (see also <a href="#c19">Skaalvik &amp; Rankin, 1995a</a>, <a href="#c20"> 1995b</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Interestingly, previous studies that tested the I/E model characteristically used either measures of self-perceptions in reference to the broader verbal and math domains (e.g., <a href="#c11">Marsh et al., 1988</a>; <a href="#c12">Marsh &amp; Shavelson, 1985</a>; <a href="#c13">Marsh et al., 1991</a>; <a href="#c18">Skaalvik &amp; Rankin, 1990</a>, <a href="#c19"> 1995a</a>, <a href="#c20"> 1995b</a>) or subject-specific self-concepts in English and math only (e.g., <a href="#c9">Marsh, 1990b</a>). Different results can be expected when diverse subject-specific judgments form the basis for more general verbal and math self-perceptions. When <a href="#c10">Marsh (1990c)</a>
examined the relation between higher order verbal and math self-concepts based on various subject-specific self-concepts, strong positive correlations (range = .55–.68) were observed in different factor models. One purpose of the present investigation, therefore, was to determine whether the results reported with more general measures of self-efficacy could be replicated with subject-specific measures.</p><a id="edu-90-1-102-ID0EDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_20" title="Underlying Assumptions of the I/E Model">Underlying Assumptions of the I/E Model</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Most existing evidence for the I/E comparison processes in operation comes from the negative paths linking achievements to self-concepts in the opposite area plus a near-zero correlation between verbal and math self-concepts.

Rather surprisingly, verbal achievement failed to exert a significant influence on verbal academic self-efficacy. One of the verbal first-order factors (i.e., Spanish academic self-efficacy) did not share a meaningful proportion of its variance with other verbal factors (i.e., English and American history academic self-efficacy). This might have contributed to attenuating the observed relationship between verbal achievement and verbal academic self-efficacy. However, an additional analysis carried out with English and math (i.e., algebra and geometry) only produced essentially the same result, although the path linking English achievement to English academic self-efficacy became somewhat stronger. Another possibility is the relative complexity of achievement indexes in verbal subjects compared with those in quantitative subjects. Certain academic tasks that students are required to perform to receive grades cannot easily be represented as a single particularized problem. This is more so in verbal subjects than in math-related subjects. Math achievement showed a strong positive effect on math academic self-efficacy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to the I/E model, significant negative paths should exist from achievement in one area to self-concept in the other area. With self-efficacy measures, only verbal achievement manifested a direct negative effect on math academic self-efficacy.

Finally, disturbance terms of verbal and math academic self-efficacy were strongly correlated to each other, challenging one of the I/E model's main provisions.</p><a id="edu-90-1-102-ID0ECBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Relations Between Frame-Specific Academic Self-Concepts</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The I/E model provides specific assumptions regarding the relations between verbal and math self-concepts, depending on the types of comparison students engage in.

According to the I/E model, students' verbal and math self-concepts are positively correlated after the external comparison and negatively correlated after the internal comparison. A CFA model with four frame-specific latent variables—internal verbal (i.e., verbal self-concept based on the internal comparison frame), external verbal, internal math, and external math—was specified to test these assumptions.

Furthermore, achievement in one area significantly and negatively influenced academic self-concept in the opposite area. After all, achievement was negatively correlated with both internal and external self-concept factors in the other area, which were used as the bases of the second-order self-concept factors. The only exception to the I/E model's provision was the relation between disturbance terms of verbal and math self-concepts. The I/E model stipulates a near-zero correlation between verbal and math self-concepts. In path models, this is reflected in a near-zero correlation between disturbance terms of the two self-concept factors (see <a href="#c9">Marsh, 1990b</a>). The substantial and positive correlation evidenced between disturbance terms of verbal and math self-concepts in the present model is, therefore, disconcerting.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The set of analyses conducted in this article demonstrated that the proposed negative relationship between achievement in one area and self-concept in the opposite area, one of the key parameters in the I/E model, can be achieved without satisfying various underlying assumptions of the I/E model. This makes it very hard for one to resist the temptation of reversing the direction of causality between the self and achievement factors. The fit of the model hypothesizing causal predominance of self-concept over achievement was as good as that of the classical I/E model, χ<sup>2</sup>(186, <em>N</em>

More important, negative relations between achievement in one area and self-concept in the other area disappeared. Instead, achievement in one area was independent of self-concept in the opposite area (−.09 between verbal self-concept and math achievement and .00 between math self-concept and verbal achievement; both <em>p</em>

Together with inconsistent relations observed between achievement and efficacy factors in the opposite areas, the internal comparison processes appeared to exert only a negligible impact, if any, on academic self-efficacy formation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Findings from the present investigation do not exclude the possibility of external comparison processes operating in self-efficacy formation. Schunk and his colleagues (e.g., <a href="#c14">Schunk, 1983</a>; <a href="#c16">Schunk &amp; Hanson, 1985</a>; <a href="#c17">Schunk, Hanson, &amp; Cox, 1987</a>) proved that social comparative experiences could provide critical information for gauging one's perceived efficacy. However, effects of vicarious experiences on self-efficacy formation are weaker than those of personal enactive experiences (<a href="#c1">Bandura, 1977</a>, <a href="#c2"> 1986</a>; <a href="#c15">Schunk, 1991</a>). Several researchers also suspected that the external comparison processes would play only a limited role in efficacy appraisal because self-efficacy is often judged in reference to specific performance criteria (<a href="#c13">Marsh et al., 1991</a>; <a href="#c22">Zimmerman, 1995</a>). Future research can explore conditions under which the external comparison processes assume a predominant role in determining students' academic self-efficacy.</p><a id="edu-90-1-102-ID0EAACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Testing Underlying Assumptions of the I/E Model With Frame-Specific Academic Self-Concepts</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to the I/E model (<a href="#c7">Marsh, 1986</a>, <a href="#c9"> 1990b</a>), students compare their academic skills in verbal and math domains to their peers' skills in the same area and use the results of this social comparison as one basis for their academic self-concepts. Students also compare their verbal skills to their math skills and incorporate this relativistic appreciation of ability as a second basis for their academic self-concepts. Technically speaking, verbal and math academic self-concepts should display a positive correlation after the external comparison and a negative correlation after the internal comparison. Unfortunately, even when students were explicitly instructed to compare their ability in one domain with their ability in other domains (i.e., internal comparison), their verbal and math self-concepts so created failed to demonstrate a negative relationship. The relation between external comparison-based verbal and math self-concepts was positive as the I/E model presumes but rather weak in light of the strong correlations frequently observed between verbal and math achievements.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The I/E model contends that the correlation between verbal and math self-concepts can be positive or negative, depending on the relative contribution of the two comparison processes. The strong positive correlation between verbal and math self-concepts may thus be taken as evidence that students in the present study assigned considerably more weight to the external comparison processes. However, as pointed out earlier, the direct link between the external factors was not strong enough. When the achievement factors entered the equation in the first-order path model, achievement in one area was negatively related to internal as well as external comparison-based self-concepts in the other area, indicating superior effects of internal, instead of external, comparison processes in operation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c10">Marsh (1990c)</a>
reported strong positive correlations between verbal and math self-concepts, as did the current study. The common attribute of Marsh's study and the present investigation is that subject-specific judgments of academic capability formed the basis for more general verbal and math self-concepts. When students assess their perceived effectiveness in verbal and math domains in general, comparative superiority of achievement in one domain over the other can be accentuated. In contrast, when students assess their academic capability in a number of school subjects, multiple comparison frames may exist for each subject-specific self-concept. Consequently, the effects of internal comparison processes as illustrated by the I/E model are minimized.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, results from the present investigation do not provide clear support for the I/E model with either subject-specific academic self-efficacy or frame-specific academic self-concepts. Present findings provide room for questioning the I/E model's contention that students spontaneously, if not voluntarily, undergo two separate comparison processes when reporting their self-perceived capability. At least with academic self-efficacy measures, students' judgments of their own competence appear to be constructed without the internal comparison processes. More direct tests of the I/E model can take the form of experimental design. It will be interesting to see whether students' self-concepts in verbal and math subjects are positively, negatively, or insignificantly correlated after experimentally accentuating as comparison frames their peers' ability in the same area, their own competence in different school subjects, or both. Future research should also test the hypothesis that assessing academic self-concepts in diverse school subjects versus verbal and math domains in general compromises contribution of the internal comparison processes in determining students' academic self-concepts. As <a href="#c8">Marsh (1990a)</a>
pointed out, no studies have yet pursued causal relations between self-concept and achievement factors with the distinction between verbal and math factors—as illustrated by the I/E model—accommodated. More stringent and perhaps more accurate tests of the I/E model, therefore, call for longitudinal studies of relations among verbal and math self-concepts and achievements, with temporal precedence of achievements over academic self-concepts clearly established.</p><a id="edu-90-1-102-ID0EXABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_81" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Bandura, A.
