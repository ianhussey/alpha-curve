Some writers thought contact between the races under conditions of equality would only breed “suspicion, fear, resentment, disturbance, and at times open conflict” (<a href="#c4">Baker, 1934</a>, p. 120). Others proposed that interracial experiences could lead to “mutual understanding and regard” (<a href="#c65">Lett, 1945</a>, p. 35) and that when groups “are isolated from one another, prejudice and conflict grow like a disease” (<a href="#c11">Brameld, 1946</a>, p. 245; see also <a href="#c121">Watson, 1946</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Early studies of intergroup contact provided preliminary tests of these proposals and revealed encouraging trends. After the U.S. Merchant Marine began desegregating, <a href="#c12">Brophy (1946)</a> found that the more voyages the White seamen took with Blacks, the more positive their racial attitudes became. Likewise, White police officers who worked with Black colleagues later objected less to having Blacks join their police districts, teaming with a Black partner, and taking orders from Black officers (<a href="#c63">Kephart, 1957</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As studies of intergroup contact grew in number, the Social Science Research Council asked Robin Williams, Jr., a Cornell University sociologist, to review research on group relations. <a href="#c122">Williams's (1947)</a> monograph, <em>The Reduction of Intergroup Tensions</em>, offers 102 testable “propositions” on intergroup relations that include an initial formulation of intergroup contact theory. In particular, he noted that intergroup contact would maximally reduce prejudice when the two groups share similar status, interests, and tasks and when the situation fosters personal, intimate intergroup contact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Researchers then began to test the theory more rigorously. Field studies of public housing provided the strongest evidence and marked the introduction of large-scale field research into North American social psychology. In a notable example of this work, <a href="#c28">Deutsch and Collins (1951)</a> interviewed White housewives across different public housing projects with a design that <a href="#c16">Campbell and Stanley (1963)</a> later labeled “quasi-experimental.” Two housing projects in Newark assigned Black and White residents to separate buildings. Two comparable housing projects in New York City desegregated residents by making apartment assignments irrespective of race or personal preference. The authors found that White women in the desegregated projects had far more optimal contact with their Black neighbors. Moreover, they held their Black neighbors in higher esteem and expressed greater support for interracial housing. Further research extended this work, showing that equal-status interracial contact in public housing related to more positive feelings and intergroup attitudes for both Blacks and Whites (<a href="#c123">Wilner, Walkley, &amp; Cook, 1952</a>; <a href="#c126">Works, 1961</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Armed with Williams's initial effort and the rich findings of the housing studies, <a href="#c1">Allport (1954)</a> introduced the most influential statement of intergroup contact theory in <em>The Nature of Prejudice</em>. His formulation of intergroup contact theory maintained that contact between groups under optimal conditions could effectively reduce intergroup prejudice. In particular, Allport held that reduced prejudice will result when four features of the contact situation are present: equal status between the groups in the situation; common goals; intergroup cooperation; and the support of authorities, law, or custom.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Allport's formulation of intergroup contact theory has inspired extensive research over the past half century (<a href="#c86">Pettigrew, 1998</a>; <a href="#c87">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2000</a>). These investigations range across a variety of groups, situations, and societies. Going beyond a focus on racial and ethnic groups, investigators have tested the theory with participants of varying ages and with target groups as diverse as elderly, physically disabled, and mentally ill participants. Contact studies also have used a wide variety of research methods and procedures, including archival research (e.g., <a href="#c38">Fine, 1979</a>), field studies (e.g., <a href="#c28">Deutsch &amp; Collins, 1951</a>), laboratory experiments (e.g., <a href="#c21">Cook, 1969</a>, <a href="#c22">1978</a>), and surveys (e.g., <a href="#c85">Pettigrew, 1997</a>; <a href="#c102">Sigelman &amp; Welch, 1993</a>). In addition to spanning many disciplines, contact theory has been usefully applied to a host of pressing social issues ranging from the racial desegregation of schools (<a href="#c83">Pettigrew, 1971</a>) and the resolution of ethnopolitical conflicts (<a href="#c19">Chirot &amp; Seligman, 2001</a>) to explaining regional differences in prejudice (<a href="#c120">Wagner, van Dick, Pettigrew, &amp; Christ, 2003</a>) and the educational mainstreaming of physically and mentally disabled children (<a href="#c48">Harper &amp; Wacker, 1985</a>; <a href="#c76">Naor &amp; Milgram, 1980</a>).</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_15" title="Past Reviews of the Intergroup Contact Literature">Past Reviews of the Intergroup Contact Literature</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Past reviews of this vast literature have often reached conflicting conclusions regarding the likely effects of intergroup contact. Numerous reviews show general support for contact theory, suggesting that intergroup contact typically reduces intergroup prejudice (<a href="#c23">Cook, 1984</a>; <a href="#c49">Harrington &amp; Miller, 1992</a>; <a href="#c60">Jackson, 1993</a>; <a href="#c82">Patchen, 1999</a>; <a href="#c83">Pettigrew, 1971</a>, <a href="#c84">1986</a>, <a href="#c86">1998</a>). However, other reviews reach more mixed conclusions. <a href="#c2">Amir (1969</a>, <a href="#c3">1976</a>) conceded that contact under optimal conditions tends to reduce prejudice among participants, but he stressed that these reductions in prejudice may not generalize to entire outgroups. Moreover, <a href="#c3">Amir (1976)</a> noted that contact under unfavorable conditions “may increase prejudice and intergroup tension” (p. 308). Likewise, <a href="#c39">Forbes (1997)</a>, a political scientist, concluded that intergroup contact often lowers prejudice at the individual level of analysis but fails to do so at the group level of analysis. Hence, he argued that contact can cure individual prejudice but not group conflict.<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c105">Stephan (1987)</a> acknowledged that intergroup contact has the potential to reduce prejudice, but he emphasized the complexity involved in the link between intergroup contact and prejudice. For example, characteristics of the contact setting, the groups under study, and the individuals involved may all contribute to enhancing or inhibiting contact's effects (see also <a href="#c82">Patchen, 1999</a>; <a href="#c86">Pettigrew, 1998</a>; <a href="#c94">Riordan, 1978</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Additional reviews have been more critical regarding the potential for contact to promote positive intergroup outcomes. <a href="#c41">Ford (1986)</a> examined 53 papers (from six journals) on contact. He found support for the contact hypothesis to be, at best, “premature” and that the research presented in these papers was “grossly insufficient in representing the various settings of daily life” (<a href="#c41">Ford, 1986</a>, p. 256). <a href="#c72">McClendon (1974)</a> suggested that “contact research has been rather unsophisticated and lacking in rigor” (p. 47) and concluded that this body of work “would not lead [one] to expect a widespread reduction in prejudice” (p. 52).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Such conflicting views regarding the effects of contact have led some social psychologists to discard contact theory. Indeed, as <a href="#c57">Hopkins, Reicher, and Levine (1997)</a> asserted, some believe that “the initial hopes of contact theorists have failed to materialize” (p. 306). However, three major shortcomings of these past reviews may account for their divergent conclusions.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0ECFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Incomplete Samples of Relevant Papers</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Whereas there have been literally dozens of partial reviews of the contact literature, we are not aware of any review of this vast literature that attempts to encompass the entire relevant research base. Instead, past reviews have typically been restricted to a particular set of groups, such as racial or ethnic groups (e.g., <a href="#c82">Patchen, 1999</a>), or a particular contact setting, such as interracial housing (e.g., <a href="#c15">Cagle, 1973</a>) or schools (e.g., <a href="#c17">Carithers, 1970</a>). Further examination also reveals that these reviews covered a mean of less than 60 research articles each, compared with the hundreds of studies that comprise the contact research literature. Thus, past reviews offer only limited views regarding the effects of intergroup contact.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EBFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Absence of Strict Inclusion Rules</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With no inclusion rules, these previous reviews used sharply contrasting definitions of intergroup contact. For example, some reviews included studies that used intergroup proximity, rather than established contact, as the independent variable. This procedure may contribute considerable error to the analysis and obscure the test of contact's influence on prejudice.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EAFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nonquantitative Assessments of Contact Effects</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moreover, none of the previous reviews used fully quantitative assessments of contact effects. Instead, authors of past reviews have tended to offer subjective judgments of the contact–prejudice relationship that are based on their own readings of a subset of the research literature. Although this approach can be useful, selection biases and differing interpretations of the literature limit the ability to reach definitive conclusions about contact's effects. Thus, quantitative approaches to research synthesis are preferred, as they provide a means for examining replicable patterns of effects across the full accumulation of relevant studies (<a href="#c62">Johnson &amp; Eagly, 2000</a>; <a href="#c95">Rosenthal, 1991</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given these limitations of past reviews and the diverse nature of contact research, the evaluation of this literature requires a meta-analytic approach. Yet, to our knowledge, no investigators have conducted such an analysis of this vast and rich research literature. Thus, a central goal of the present research was to assess the overall effect between intergroup contact and prejudice on the basis of the population of empirical studies that constitute the research literature of the 20th century. With a quantitative means of analyzing a far greater number of relevant studies chosen by strict inclusion rules, we aim to determine more conclusively than past reviews the overall relationship between intergroup contact and prejudice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present article reports on such an effort, utilizing 515 individual studies with 713 independent samples and 1,383 nonindependent tests. Combined, 250,089 individuals from 38 nations participated in the research. Along with including more than 300 additional studies, this work extends an earlier preliminary analysis, presented in <a href="#c87">Pettigrew and Tropp (2000)</a>, in several important theoretical and empirical directions.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_33" title="Testing and Reinterpreting Allport's Optimal Conditions">Testing and Reinterpreting Allport's Optimal Conditions</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Whereas intergroup contact theory has traditionally held that Allport's optimal conditions are essential, we propose that Allport's conditions facilitate contact's reduction of intergroup prejudice. Social psychology has shown repeatedly that greater exposure to targets can, in and of itself, significantly enhance liking for those targets (<a href="#c10">Bornstein, 1989</a>; <a href="#c47">Harmon-Jones &amp; Allen, 2001</a>; <a href="#c64">Lee, 2001</a>; <a href="#c127">Zajonc, 1968</a>; see also <a href="#c55">Homans, 1950</a>). Moreover, studies with social targets have shown that the enhanced liking that results from exposure can generalize to greater liking for other related, yet previously unknown, social targets (<a href="#c93">Rhodes, Halberstadt, &amp; Brajkovich, 2001</a>). Applying this work to intergroup contact research, the mere exposure perspective suggests that, all things being equal, greater contact and familiarity with members of other groups should enhance liking for those groups. Thus, in the present analysis, we test whether intergroup contact is associated with less prejudice even when Allport's conditions are not established in the contact situation, as well as whether these conditions significantly enhance the degree to which contact promotes positive intergroup outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Extending our earlier, preliminary analysis (<a href="#c87">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2000</a>), we examine these issues in three ways. Initially, we use a global indicator of Allport's conditions: structured programs designed to achieve optimal conditions. We test whether including this indicator in the contact situation is necessary to produce positive intergroup outcomes and whether it typically enhances the positive effects of contact. To check for the consistency of these effects, we then compare the results for our full sample with those subsets of cases that either do or do not involve racial and ethnic contact. In addition, for the subset of 134 samples that feature a structured situation boasting many of Allport's proposed conditions, we rate each condition separately and examine the average effect sizes associated with each condition.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_38" title="Ruling Out Alternative Explanations for Contact–Prejudice Effects">Ruling Out Alternative Explanations for Contact–Prejudice Effects</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present analysis also includes additional tests that allow us to test more effectively four alternative explanations for contact–prejudice effects.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EEDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participant Selection and the Causal Sequence Problem</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A potential participant selection bias could limit the interpretation of many studies of intergroup contact (<a href="#c86">Pettigrew, 1998</a>). Instead of optimal contact reducing prejudice, the opposite causal sequence could be at work. Prejudiced people may avoid, and tolerant people may seek, contact with outgroups.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Statistical methods borrowed from econometrics allow researchers to compare roughly the reciprocal paths (contact lowers prejudice vs. prejudice decreases contact) with cross-sectional data. As shown directly in other research (e.g., <a href="#c52">Herek &amp; Capitanio, 1996</a>), these methods reveal that prejudiced people do indeed avoid intergroup contact. But the path from contact to reduced prejudice is generally much stronger (<a href="#c14">Butler &amp; Wilson, 1978</a>; <a href="#c85">Pettigrew, 1997</a>; <a href="#c91">Powers &amp; Ellison, 1995</a>; <a href="#c115">Van Dick et al., 2004</a>). Longitudinal studies also have revealed that optimal contact reduces prejudice over time (e.g., <a href="#c35">Eller &amp; Abrams, 2003</a>, <a href="#c36">2004</a>; <a href="#c66">Levin, van Laar, &amp; Sidanius, 2003</a>), even when researchers have eliminated the possibility of participant selection (e.g., <a href="#c101">Sherif, 1966</a>). Thus, various methods suggest that, although both sequences operate, the more important effect is that of intergroup contact reducing prejudice.<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present analysis, we respond to this concern by concentrating on intergroup situations that severely limit choice (see <a href="#c68">Link &amp; Cullen, 1986</a>). By eliminating the possibility of initial attitudes leading to differential contact, such research provides a clearer indication of the causal relationship between intergroup contact and prejudice. We make use of this method in our analyses by coding samples for the extent to which participants could choose to engage in the contact. Of course, experiments limit choice through randomization of subjects to condition. But our choice rating is not simply a surrogate variable for experimental designs. Almost half of our quasi-experimental samples, and even 31 samples with weaker designs, allowed no participant choice.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EDDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The File Drawer: Publication Bias Problem</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another major potential threat to the interpretation of our results pertains to the file drawer problem that besets all literature reviews (<a href="#c5">Begg, 1994</a>; <a href="#c95">Rosenthal, 1991</a>). Published studies may form a biased subset of the relevant studies actually conducted, as the statistical significance of a study's results may influence the probability of it being submitted and published. Indeed, investigators have demonstrated this bias in both the social science and medical research literatures (<a href="#c25">Coursol &amp; Wagner, 1986</a>; <a href="#c29">Dickersin, 1997</a>; <a href="#c30">Dickersin, Min, &amp; Meinert, 1992</a>; <a href="#c34">Easterbrook, Berlin, Gopalan, &amp; Mathews, 1991</a>; <a href="#c44">Glass, McCaw, &amp; Smith, 1981</a>; <a href="#c69">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 1993</a>; <a href="#c97">Rotton, Foos, Van Meek, &amp; Levitt, 1995</a>; <a href="#c100">Shadish, Doherty, &amp; Montgomery, 1989</a>; <a href="#c103">Smith, 1980</a>; <a href="#c104">Sommer, 1987</a>). Researchers may be reluctant to send in studies with modest or countertheory findings. And journals may publish studies with large effects and reject studies with small or no effects. Thus, reviews may systematically overestimate effect sizes, as they rely heavily on published work.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Estimating publication bias is a difficult task, but numerous investigators have directed considerable attention to the problem in recent years. The many tests for bias are based on particular assumptions and consequently have their unique strengths and shortcomings (<a href="#c111">Sutton, Song, Gilbody, &amp; Abrams, 2000</a>). In the present research, we investigated this potentially serious problem from multiple directions by using a variety of tests and thereby extend our analysis beyond our initial findings (<a href="#c87">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2000</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">First, following <a href="#c95">Rosenthal (1991)</a>, we calculated a fail-safe index. Though often criticized, this technique is one of the most widely used methods for crudely gauging publication bias (<a href="#c111">Sutton, Song, et al., 2000</a>). It reveals how many missing studies that average no relationship between contact and prejudice (<em>Z</em> = .00) would be required to raise the significance levels above the .05 or .01 level of confidence. But this focus is the index's basic weakness. It assumes that the missing studies will average to no effect. Thus, the fail-safe index underestimates publication bias to the extent that the average of the missing studies runs counter to the hypothesis being tested.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Other rough, initial tests involve the relationship between sample size and effect size. We can test for the possibility of publication bias in several ways. Two preliminary methods are simply to correlate sample sizes with effect sizes and to develop a funnel graph consisting of a scatter diagram with the two variables (<a href="#c67">Light &amp; Pillemer, 1984</a>). A nonsignificant correlation and a symmetrical funnel graph each suggest minimal publication bias.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The funnel graph in turn relates to two additional methods of testing for publication bias. The “trim-and-fill” technique detects potentially missing studies by adjusting for funnel plot asymmetry (<a href="#c32">Duval &amp; Tweedie, 2000a</a>, <a href="#c33">2000b</a>; <a href="#c110">Sutton, Duval, Tweedie, Abrams, &amp; Jones, 2000</a>). The general linear model approach of <a href="#c118">Vevea and Hedges (1995)</a> focuses on the absence of small studies. It assumes that random effects are distributed normally and that the survival probability of a given study can be described by a stop function around such critical probability points as .05 and .01. It should be noted, however, that such funnel graph methods tend to overestimate publication bias (<a href="#c109">Sterne &amp; Egger, 2000</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, we also tested directly whether this particular literature suffers from the file drawer problem. We compared the effect sizes between intergroup contact and prejudice from published sources (journals and books) and unpublished sources (graduate dissertations, conference papers, and other unpublished manuscripts). This method also makes a critical assumption, namely, that the unpublished studies that we uncovered constitute a random sample of unpublished research on the topic. For this and other reasons, the power of this direct approach, as <a href="#c5">Begg (1994)</a> noted, is “directly proportional to the assiduousness of the search” (p. 405). Thus, we expended great effort in obtaining as many unpublished manuscripts as possible. We uncovered 88 unpublished contact studies, 70% of which are graduate dissertations.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0ECDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Generalization of Effects Problem</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A third issue concerns the generalization of contact effects—an issue not fully addressed by <a href="#c1">Allport (1954</a>; see <a href="#c86">Pettigrew, 1998</a>). Critics generally concede that intergroup contact often leads to improved attitudes among the participants. But the critical question is whether these altered attitudes generalize beyond the immediate situation to new situations, to the entire outgroup, or even to outgroups not involved in the contact (<a href="#c85">Pettigrew, 1997</a>, <a href="#c86">1998</a>). Such generalization is crucial to the useful application of contact theory. If the changes wrought by contact are limited to the particular situation and the immediate outgroup participants, the practical value of the theory is obviously severely restricted. Hence, we examine whether each test of the link between contact and prejudice involves some generalization beyond the immediate contact situation and participants.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EBDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Rigor of Research Studies</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A final test of validity involves the relationship between indices of research rigor and the magnitude of the contact–prejudice effect sizes. If less rigorous research was largely responsible for the average effect size between contact and prejudice, we would hesitate to accept it as established. But if the more rigorous studies produce stronger contact effects, it would lend credibility to the results. Meta-analysts have checked on this issue with a variety of generally accepted indices of rigor. We used five rated variables: type of study, type of contact measure, type of control group, quality of the contact measure, and quality of the prejudice measure.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EADCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study and Participant Characteristics as Moderators of Contact–Prejudice Effects</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition to examining variables of theoretical and methodological interest, we also identify and analyze other possible sources of variability in the contact–prejudice relationship. With our extensive set of contact studies, we consider a range of study and participant characteristics that may moderate the relationship between contact and prejudice. In addition to the aforementioned indicators of research rigor, we examine contact–prejudice effects in relation to the date of publication, the study setting, and the geographical area in which the research was conducted. We also inspect contact–prejudice effects in relation to participant characteristics such as age, gender, and the types of groups involved in the contact.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_64" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EDCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Inclusion Criteria</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We define intergroup contact as actual face-to-face interaction between members of clearly defined groups. From this definition flow several inclusion criteria.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Criterion 1</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because our focus is on the relationship between intergroup contact and prejudice, we consider only those empirical studies in which intergroup contact acts as the independent variable and intergroup prejudice as the dependent variable. Eligible studies include both experimental studies that test for the effects of contact on prejudice and correlational studies that use contact as a correlate or predictor of prejudice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Criterion 2</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Only research that involves contact between members of discrete groups is included. This rule ensures that we examine intergroup outcomes of contact rather than interpersonal outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Criterion 3</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The research must report on some degree of direct intergroup interaction. For inclusion, the intergroup interaction must be observed directly, reported by participants, or occur in focused, long-term situations where direct contact is unavoidable (e.g., small classrooms).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This third rule eliminates a variety of studies that are often cited in previous summaries of contact research. In particular, it excludes research that uses rough proximity or group proportions to infer intergroup interaction. As <a href="#c37">Festinger and Kelley (1951)</a> made clear a half century ago, proximity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for social contact. One cannot assume contact from the opportunity for contact, such as living in an intergroup neighborhood with no report of actual interaction (e.g., <a href="#c46">Hamilton &amp; Bishop, 1976</a>; <a href="#c56">Hood &amp; Morris, 2000</a>). Our rare exceptions carefully demonstrated that the intergroup proximity correlated highly with actual contact, as it did in <a href="#c28">Deutsch and Collins's (1951)</a> famous interracial housing study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This rule also omits investigations that attempt to gauge contact with indirect measures such as information about an outgroup (e.g., <a href="#c112">Taft, 1959</a>). We also excluded studies that asked about attitudes toward contact, unless the researchers directly linked such indicators to prior intergroup experience (e.g., <a href="#c40">Ford, 1941</a>). In addition, this rule eliminates research that categorizes participants into groups that do not directly interact, as is the case in many minimal group studies (e.g., <a href="#c80">Otten, Mummendey, &amp; Blanz, 1996</a>; <a href="#c113">Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, &amp; Flament, 1971</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This inclusion rule is important and differs from many prior reviews of this literature. The extensive research by <a href="#c18">Catlin (1977)</a> on the impact of interracial dormitories at the University of Michigan illustrates the rule's operation. Catlin found only small relationships between interracial living and prejudice, but we did not enter these aggregate results into our files. However, Catlin also checked on the racial attitudes of White students who reported on whether they had Black acquaintances. We used these results because cross-racial “acquaintance” directly specifies face-to-face contact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Criterion 4</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The prejudice dependent variables must be collected on individuals rather than simply as a total aggregate outcome. Thus, studies concerning the relationships between contact and prejudice were included only if they used individuals as the unit of analysis such that prejudice scores could be examined in relation to individuals' contact experiences.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Locating Relevant Studies</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To locate studies that meet our inclusion rules, we used a wide variety of search procedures. First, we conducted computer searches of the psychological (PsychLIT and PsycINFO), sociological (SocAbs and SocioFile), political science (GOV), education (ERIC), dissertation (UMI Dissertation Abstracts), and general research periodical (Current Contents) abstracts published through December 2000. These searches used 54 different search terms ranging from single words (e.g., <em>contact</em>, <em>interracial</em>) to combined terms (e.g., <em>age</em> + <em>intergroup contact</em>, <em>disabled + contact</em>). Across the various databases, we conducted three types of searches: by title words, by keyword, and by subject. Following the “descendancy approach” described by <a href="#c62">Johnson and Eagly (2000)</a>, we used the <em>Social Sciences Citation Index</em> to check on later citations of seminal contact studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To reach the “invisible college” of intergroup contact researchers, we wrote personal letters to researchers who published relevant research and sent for pertinent unpublished conference papers. Reference lists from located studies and previous reviews proved a rich source. We also repeatedly requested relevant materials through e-mail networks of social psychologists in Australia, Europe, and North America. These methods yielded 526 papers (reporting 515 studies), written between 1940 and the end of 2000, that meet our inclusion criteria. These studies yield 713 independent samples and 1,383 individual tests. Most of the studies comprise journal articles published during the past 3 decades (median year of publication = 1986). Slightly more than half of the samples (51%) focused on racial or ethnic target groups. In addition to conducting analyses for the full set of samples, we conducted analyses with this subset exclusively as well as with the remaining subset that used nonracial and nonethnic targets. Whereas 38 different countries contribute data, the United States provides 71% of the studies. Survey and field research constitute 71% of the studies, quasi-experiments 24%, and true experiments 5%. The research typically used college students or adult participants of both sexes who reported on their intergroup contact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several prototypical studies predominate. The principal prototype is a questionnaire or survey study. This research uses retrospective reports of personal contact with the outgroup. A quite different prototype uses experiments that involve an intergroup contact intervention and checks to see whether the treatment influences the participants' prejudice. A final prototype uses various quasi-experimental designs. These studies mirror the experimental research, but they lack randomization of participants to condition in between-groups designs. These three basic prototypes shaped the research moderators and other techniques that we use in the meta-analysis.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Computation and Analysis of Effect Sizes</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Whereas most past meta-analytic studies in social psychology have used fixed effects models (<a href="#c62">Johnson &amp; Eagly, 2000</a>), the nature of the contact research literature makes a random effects model more appropriate for our analysis.<a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup><a href="#fn3" /></sup>
This model holds that part of the differences in effects across studies is essentially random and involves unidentifiable sources (<a href="#c50">Hedges, 1994</a>; <a href="#c51">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985</a>; <a href="#c70">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</a>; <a href="#c75">Mosteller &amp; Colditz, 1996</a>; <a href="#c92">Raudenbush, 1994</a>; <a href="#c96">Rosenthal, 1995</a>). As <a href="#c24">Cook et al. (1992)</a> concluded, this approach is “particularly attractive when considering (1) studies that are quite heterogeneous, (2) treatments that are ill-specified, and/or (3) effects that are complex and multidetermined” (p. 310). Because all three of these conditions hold for much of the intergroup contact literature, we used a random effects model. An additional advantage of using the random effects approach is that it allows our findings to be generalized to other contact studies beyond those used in our analysis. This choice is a conservative procedure that markedly reduces the probability levels obtained.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We report Pearson's <em>r</em> as our indicator of effect size throughout our analysis. If the studies do not report this measure, we derived it from other statistics by using the conversion formulas provided by <a href="#c61">Johnson (1993)</a>. A negative mean effect size indicates that greater intergroup contact is associated with lower prejudice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">If researchers reported a relationship as nonsignificant, we conservatively assigned a value of .00 for the effect size. <a href="#c96">Rosenthal (1995)</a> has questioned this procedure as too conservative and likely to yield misleadingly low effect size estimates. He has recommended that meta-analysts conduct principal analyses both with and without these studies—a procedure that we follow in our summary analyses, although only 17 (2.4%) of our samples are involved. We also follow the suggestion of <a href="#c62">Johnson and Eagly (2000)</a> and omit these samples when we fit our moderator models to the effect sizes. The small number of samples involved means that they affect only slightly the total effect size.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We used two primary units of analysis: independent samples and individual tests. The use of independent samples is helpful because they are more numerous than are studies and allow detailed comparisons. Tests are especially numerous and allow us to compare effect sizes for even more detailed factors. But multiple tests reported for a single sample violate assumptions of independence, and we have an average of almost two tests per sample. Thus, we used tests as our unit of analysis for just one potential moderator (type of generalization) that can be measured at this level only.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For each category of effect sizes, we calculated the mean effect size, weighted for sample size. Thus, the larger and more reliable samples contribute proportionately more to the mean. The homogeneity of each set of effect sizes was examined by calculating the homogeneity statistic <em>Q</em> that has an approximate chi-square distribution with <em>k</em>−1 degrees of freedom, where <em>k</em> is the number of effect sizes (<a href="#c51">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Weighting by sample size, however, posed a problem. Five especially large studies constitute only 1% of our study file but 28% of the total number of participants. To keep these few studies from having such enormous influence on the results, we capped their study sizes at 5,000, sample sizes at 3,000, and tests at 2,000 participants. Whereas these caps are arbitrary, only seven samples and 17 tests are involved. As <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> shows, omitting the studies that report only “nonsignificant” effects and applying these sample size caps results in only trivial differences of the average effect size across studies, samples, and tests for both fixed effects models and random effects models.<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/c59893f071cf306c400104d88ffafd30/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-tbl1a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-tbl1a.gif" title="Summary of Effect Sizes for Contact and Prejudice" /><em>Summary of Effect Sizes for Contact and Prejudice</em></span></p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Ratings for Studies and Samples</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We rated and recorded 16 separate variables at their appropriate levels of analysis. <a href="#tbl2">Tables 2–5</a> and 11–12 provide the particular categories used for the ratings of each of these variables, and the Appendix supplies the ratings for each sample.<br /><br /><a id="tbl2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/a7edf4c113581571ed8e1062a3c75c9f/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-tbl2a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-tbl2a.gif" title="Testing Threats to Validity for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes" /><em>Testing Threats to Validity for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes</em></span><br /><br /><a id="tbl3"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/e4d17e2985818530acfb0bb8f4264edd/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-tbl3a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-tbl3a.gif" title="Type of Study, Control Group, and Contact Measure as Moderators for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes" /><em>Type of Study, Control Group, and Contact Measure as Moderators for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes</em></span><br /><br /><a id="tbl4"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/9901e5b6682202c3e7d93a7bb93e7e3a/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-tbl4a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-tbl4a.gif" title="Quality of Contact and Prejudice Indicators as Moderators for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes" /><em>Quality of Contact and Prejudice Indicators as Moderators for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes</em></span><br /><br /><a id="tbl5"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/832ee0bbe8cbe13bd9e2732d26dd2723/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-tbl5a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-tbl5a.gif" title="Structured Programs as a Moderator for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes" /><em>Structured Programs as a Moderator for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes</em></span><br /><br /><a id="tbl2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/a7edf4c113581571ed8e1062a3c75c9f/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-tbl2a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-tbl2a.gif" title="Testing Threats to Validity for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes" /><em>Testing Threats to Validity for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes</em></span><br /><br /><a id="tbl3"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/e4d17e2985818530acfb0bb8f4264edd/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-tbl3a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-tbl3a.gif" title="Type of Study, Control Group, and Contact Measure as Moderators for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes" /><em>Type of Study, Control Group, and Contact Measure as Moderators for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes</em></span><br /><br /><a id="tbl4"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/9901e5b6682202c3e7d93a7bb93e7e3a/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-tbl4a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-tbl4a.gif" title="Quality of Contact and Prejudice Indicators as Moderators for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes" /><em>Quality of Contact and Prejudice Indicators as Moderators for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes</em></span><br /><br /><a id="tbl5"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/832ee0bbe8cbe13bd9e2732d26dd2723/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-tbl5a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-tbl5a.gif" title="Structured Programs as a Moderator for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes" /><em>Structured Programs as a Moderator for Contact–Prejudice Effect Sizes</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Ratings of study characteristics include the date and source of publication and whether it used a within- or between-subjects design. In addition, we rated research quality in several ways. We established ratings for the type of study (e.g., survey, quasi-experiment, or experiment). We also rated the type of control group used in studies with between-subjects designs (e.g., no, some, or considerable earlier contact with the outgroup). We found that many of these control groups actually had prior contact with the target group; such “leakage” obviously renders these groups as less adequate controls. Another indicator of research rigor checked on the type of contact measure used (e.g., whether the contact was assumed from long-term situations in which contact was unavoidable, reported by the participants, or directly observed by the researchers). The quality of the measures for contact and prejudice was rated according to whether they consisted of either a single item, a multi-item scale with unreported or low reliability (α &lt; .70), a multi-item scale with high reliability (α ≥ .70), an experimental manipulation (for contact indicators only), or other forms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The ratings of participant characteristics included age, sex, and geographical area of the study and the kind of target group involved (e.g., racial or ethnic, elderly, mentally ill). Additional ratings focused on the contact situation, including the setting of the contact (e.g., educational, residential, laboratory) and whether participants had any choice in participating in the contact. Another rating concerned the type of generalization involved (e.g., to outgroup members within the situation, to the whole outgroup, across situations, or to other outgroups).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two independent judges achieved kappas above .80 for all ratings of these variables (after we collapsed error-prone adjacent rating categories). Thus, if a four-category variable had a disproportionately large number of errors at Categories 2 and 3, we combined Categories 2 and 3 to form a three-category rating. The median kappa for all ratings was .86. All discrepancies between the raters were resolved through further discussion.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We also conducted ratings to examine whether the contact situation approached the optimal context specified by Allport's key conditions. We began by attempting to rate each of Allport's four conditions individually for each study. However, this procedure proved impossible given the lack of information about situational characteristics provided by the vast majority of our 515 studies. Reliable ratings were largely unattainable for all but a subset of the studies that directly addressed the characteristics of the contact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Consequently, we conducted comparisons by using a global measure of Allport's contentions. This procedure actually offers a more direct test of the original theory, as Allport advanced his four conditions as a necessary package for positive contact effects rather than as a listing of variables that must be considered individually. In particular, we rated for all samples whether the contact situations involved structured programs designed to approximate Allport's optimal conditions.<a id="b-fn4"> </a><sup><a href="#fn4" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, for the 134 samples with contact in the context of structured programs, we attempted to conduct more fine-grained ratings for each of Allport's conditions. Though these research studies often implemented the conditions together, we used “yes” and “no” ratings to discern whether the program clearly and explicitly (a) focused participants on common goals, (b) emphasized a cooperative environment, (c) presented the groups with equal status, and (d) demonstrated authority sanction for the contact. Ratings of these variables by two independent judges yielded kappas between .76 and .97, with a median kappa of .84.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_107" title="Results">Results</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EEBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Examining the Overall Pattern of Effects: Does Intergroup Contact Reduce Prejudice?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> reveals the inverse association between intergroup contact and prejudice for all studies, samples, and tests for both fixed effects analyses and random effects analyses. The mean estimates for the contact–prejudice effect size are consistent across units of analysis, data corrections, and types of analysis. With random effects analysis, the 515 studies, 713 samples, and 1,383 tests yield mean <em>r</em>s that range from −.205 to −.214. Our data corrections of eliminating the studies, samples, and tests that did not provide precise effect sizes and capping the largest studies, samples, and tests made little difference. It is these files—with the 17 “nonsignificant” samples removed and the largest samples and tests capped—that we use in the following analyses. The fixed effects analyses and random effects analyses show similar mean effect sizes, although, as expected, the <em>Z</em>s of the random effects analyses are sharply reduced. We use the random effects model for all subsequent analyses. In sum, the initial answer to our query is that intergroup contact generally relates negatively and significantly to prejudice.<a id="b-fn5"> </a><sup><a href="#fn5" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Though in most empirical contexts, psychologists would consider this effect size to be “small” to “medium” in magnitude (<a href="#c20">Cohen, 1988</a>), we should emphasize several points. First, given the large number of samples, the effect is highly significant (<em>p</em> &lt; .0001). Second, 94% of the samples show an inverse relationship between contact and prejudice. A scatter plot of the effect sizes by sample size reveals that the effects center around an average <em>r</em> of approximately −.21, which corresponds closely to the overall mean effect size (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Finally, we later note markedly higher mean effect sizes for subsets of samples from rigorous studies.<br /><br /><a id="fig1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/999adddcb92758095e56c72f7fd60ed0/571c41d6/pdh/psp/psp-90-5-751-fig1a.gif" alt="psp-90-5-751-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

Indeed, even when we remove the results of one fifth of the samples that are the largest outliers, highly significant heterogeneity remains. Such vast heterogeneity is, of course, precisely what intergroup contact theory predicts. These studies are highly diverse as to research methods, participants, situations, and targets, all of which are potential moderators of the link between contact and prejudice. As with most meta-analyses, the ultimate thrust of our analysis is not so much the gross effect sizes but more so the moderating variables that suggest the conditions under which intergroup contact reduces prejudice. Before turning to this task, however, we first test for four threats to validity that provide alternative explanations for the findings shown in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EDBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Tests for Threats to Validity</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>The causal sequence problem: Examining choice to engage in contact</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The negative link between contact and prejudice may largely reflect the avoidance of contact by prejudiced people. If this is so, the effect sizes for those studies that provided participants with choice as to whether to engage in the intergroup contact should reveal larger effect sizes than do those that provided no such choice.

This figure is considerably larger than the 713 samples uncovered by our intensive 6-year search. Next, we check on publication bias by determining that the relationship between sample sizes and effect sizes is not significant for either the original set of 713 samples, <em>r</em> = −.02, <em>p</em> = .67, or the 696 samples included in our analysis, <em>r</em> = .04, <em>p</em> = .33.

With <em>Z</em> as the effect size and with the random effects model, Duval used her technique to estimate that about 72 (10.3%) samples were missing. When she filled in for these missing data, the effect size estimate increased to a <em>Z</em> of −.245, with 95% confidence limits of −.258 to −.231.

After adjustment for these cases, his method did not find a significant overall relationship between contact and prejudice (<em>Z</em> = −.02, <em>ns</em>). However, for those 118 samples with between-groups designs and strong controls, the adjusted effect size did reach statistical significance (mean <em>Z</em> = −.109, one-tailed, <em>p</em> &lt; .02).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, as a direct test for publication bias, we compare (in <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>) the negative mean effect sizes between intergroup contact and prejudice from published sources (journals and books) and unpublished sources (dissertations, conference papers, and other unpublished manuscripts).

The smallest mean effect results from intergroup contact through tourism and travel. Though based on only 13 samples from nine studies, this tourism effect size (mean <em>r</em> = −.113) is significantly smaller than is that of the other samples combined (mean <em>r</em> = −.217), <em>Q</em><em>B</em>(1) = 3.84, <em>p</em> &lt; .05.

It is tempting to speculate how major events, such as American racial conflict in the 1960s, might have shaped this difference. However, the difference across the two time periods is explained largely by the increased rigor of modern research. Relative to earlier work, contact research since 1979 has used more rigorous measures and procedures, as indicated by the quality of the contact measure, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 13.70, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, the quality of the prejudice measure, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 52.62, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, and the quality of the controls used in the research, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 12.14, <em>p</em> &lt; .01.

Synthesizing effects from 696 samples, the meta-analysis reveals that greater intergroup contact is generally associated with lower levels of prejudice (mean <em>r</em> = −.215). Moreover, the mean effect rises sharply for experiments and other rigorously conducted studies. In addition, 94% of the samples in our analysis show an inverse relationship between intergroup contact and prejudice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Additional findings suggest that these relationships between contact and prejudice are not artifacts of either participant selection or publication bias. Consistent with past research, the particularly strong effects observed for experimental studies confirm that contact can cause meaningful reductions in prejudice. Moreover, the investigations that allowed no choice for their participants to avoid the intergroup contact yield a slightly larger mean effect size in reducing prejudice than do studies that allowed choice. In addition, of the six tests we conducted to test for publication bias, all but one indicate that this bias is not a serious threat to the validity of our results, and the one exception still revealed a significant contact–prejudice effect among the most rigorous research studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results from our analysis also show that intergroup contact effects typically generalize beyond participants in the immediate contact situation. Indeed, the generalization of contact's effects appears to be far broader than what many past commentators have thought. Not only do attitudes toward the immediate participants usually become more favorable, but so do attitudes toward the entire outgroup, outgroup members in other situations, and even outgroups not involved in the contact. This result enhances the potential of intergroup contact to be a practical, applied means of improving intergroup relations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The findings also reveal that intergroup contact may be useful for reducing prejudice in a variety of intergroup situations and contexts. The patterns of contact–prejudice effects observed for racial and ethnic samples closely resemble those observed for the remaining samples in our analysis. Moreover, although we observe variability in the magnitude of contact–prejudice effects across different intergroup contexts, the relationships between contact and prejudice remain significant across samples involving different target groups, age groups, geographical areas, and contact settings. These results support the recent extension of intergroup contact theory to a variety of intergroup contexts, beyond its original focus on racial and ethnic groups. In sum, our meta-analytic results provide substantial evidence that intergroup contact can contribute meaningfully to reductions in prejudice across a broad range of groups and contexts.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0ECACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What Role Do Allport's Conditions Play in Helping Contact to Reduce Prejudice?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results from the meta-analysis also offer important insights regarding the role of Allport's conditions in reducing prejudice through intergroup contact. Consistent with much of the intergroup contact literature (see <a href="#c1">Allport, 1954</a>; <a href="#c86">Pettigrew, 1998</a>), those samples that experienced carefully structured contact situations designed to meet Allport's optimal conditions achieved a markedly higher mean effect size than did other samples. Moreover, a multivariate model shows that structured contact predicted stronger contact–prejudice effects, beyond that explained by multiple indices of research rigor. This trend emerged for racial and ethnic samples as well as for the remaining samples in our analysis. Taken together, these results show that establishing Allport's optimal conditions in the contact situation generally enhances the positive effects of intergroup contact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At the same time, Allport's conditions are not essential for intergroup contact to achieve positive outcomes. In particular, we found that samples with no claim to these key conditions still show significant relationships between contact and prejudice. Thus, Allport's conditions should not be regarded as necessary for producing positive contact outcomes, as researchers have often assumed in the past. Rather, they act as facilitating conditions that enhance the tendency for positive contact outcomes to emerge.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moreover, further examination of Allport's conditions suggests that institutional support may be an especially important condition for facilitating positive contact effects. Although the present analysis offers a relatively crude test, samples with structured programs showed significantly stronger contact–prejudice effects than the remaining samples, irrespective of whether they were rated as having conditions beyond authority support. At the same time, it is important to note that our ratings of authority support were conducted in the context of structured programs designed to approximate optimal conditions for positive intergroup contact. Hence, although authority support appears to play an important role, this condition should not be conceived of or implemented in isolation. Institutional support for contact under conditions of competition or unequal status can often enhance animosity between groups, thereby diminishing the potential for achieving positive outcomes from contact (see <a href="#c101">Sherif, 1966</a>). Thus, consistent with Allport's original contentions, we believe that optimal conditions for contact are best conceptualized as functioning together to facilitate positive intergroup outcomes rather than as entirely separate factors.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EBACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moving Toward a Reformulation of Intergroup Contact Theory</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Combined with other recent empirical advances, these meta-analytic findings suggest new ways of thinking about the likely effects of intergroup contact. We posit that the process underlying contact's ability to reduce prejudice involves the tendency for familiarity to breed liking. Emphasized by <a href="#c55">Homans (1950)</a> and demonstrated experimentally by <a href="#c127">Zajonc (1968)</a>, this phenomenon leads to the prediction that intergroup contact will induce liking under a wide range of conditions. Research has consistently found evidence for the relationship between exposure and liking with a range of targets (e.g., <a href="#c10">Bornstein, 1989</a>; <a href="#c47">Harmon-Jones &amp; Allen, 2001</a>; <a href="#c64">Lee, 2001</a>) and across varied research settings (e.g., <a href="#c74">Moreland &amp; Zajonc, 1977</a>; <a href="#c128">Zajonc &amp; Rajecki, 1969</a>). Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that the increases in liking that derive from exposure can generalize to greater liking for related, yet unknown, targets (<a href="#c93">Rhodes et al., 2001</a>); this is comparable to the generalization of contact's effects to unknown outgroup members.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These mere exposure findings also help to explain why Allport's optimal conditions prove not to be essential for the positive effects of contact to emerge. Although 94% of the 713 samples in our analysis showed an inverse relationship between intergroup contact and prejudice, only 19% of the samples involved contact situations structured in line with Allport's conditions.<a id="b-fn12"> </a><sup><a href="#fn12" /></sup>
Consider two relevant examples: <a href="#c116">Van Dyk (1990)</a> found that rural Afrikaans-speaking White housewives who had close contact with their African domestic workers had more favorable attitudes toward Africans in general (<em>r</em> = −.09). Conducted during the tense final days of South Africa's apartheid policy, this contact situation sharply violates Allport's key conditions. Likewise, <a href="#c27">Crain and Weisman (1972)</a> found that adult African Americans who reported having played with Whites as children were less anti-White (<em>r</em> = −.08), although they had experienced racially segregated neighborhoods and elementary schools. Like these examples, many of the meta-analysis' studies conspicuously lack Allport's key conditions for positive contact outcomes and yet report some reduction in prejudice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In turn, these trends beg the following question: If Allport's optimal conditions are not essential for achieving positive intergroup outcomes, then what might be necessary? An answer to this central question is forming from the confluence of several new lines of contemporary research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Work on the relationship between familiarity and liking suggests that uncertainty reduction is an important mechanism underlying these relationships (e.g., <a href="#c64">Lee, 2001</a>). Complementing this view, emerging perspectives have pointed to the significance of reducing intergroup anxiety to achieve reductions in prejudice from contact (<a href="#c31">Dijker, 1987</a>; <a href="#c59">Islam &amp; Hewstone, 1993</a>; <a href="#c107">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</a>; <a href="#c106">Stephan et al., 2002</a>). Intergroup anxiety refers to feelings of threat and uncertainty that people experience in intergroup contexts. These feelings grow out of concerns about how they should act, how they might be perceived, and whether they will be accepted (<a href="#c107">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</a>; see also <a href="#c6">Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975</a>; <a href="#c8">Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter, &amp; Lickel, 2000</a>; <a href="#c45">Gudykunst, 1985</a>; <a href="#c73">Mendes, Blascovich, Lickel, &amp; Hunter, 2002</a>). Indeed, <a href="#c108">Stephan, Stephan, and Gudykunst (1999)</a> have begun the task of combining the uncertainty reduction and threat reduction theories.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A rapidly growing research literature supports this fresh perspective. Studies have shown repeatedly that contact can reduce feelings of threat and anxiety about future cross-group interactions (<a href="#c7">Blair, Park, &amp; Bachelor, 2003</a>; <a href="#c9">Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter, Lickel, &amp; Kowai-Bell, 2001</a>; <a href="#c59">Islam &amp; Hewstone, 1993</a>; <a href="#c81">Paolini, Hewstone, Cairns, &amp; Voci, 2004</a>; <a href="#c107">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</a>). Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that intergroup anxiety mediates the relationships between intergroup contact and prejudice (e.g., <a href="#c81">Paolini et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#c106">Stephan et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#c119">Voci &amp; Hewstone, 2003</a>). Thus, more positive contact outcomes can be achieved to the extent that anxiety is reduced (<a href="#c13">Brown &amp; Hewstone, 2005</a>). Reducing negative feelings such as anxiety and threat represents an important means by which intergroup contact diminishes prejudice.<a id="b-fn13"> </a><sup><a href="#fn13" /></sup></p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EAACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Directions for Future Research</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings, along with recent work on familiarity and liking, suggest a new orientation for future theory and research on intergroup contact. In particular, social psychologists must grant greater attention to the negative factors that deter intergroup contact from diminishing prejudice. When <a href="#c122">Williams (1947)</a> and <a href="#c1">Allport (1954)</a> were fashioning intergroup contact theory, they assumed that most contact did not reduce prejudice. Hence, they sought to specify the positive features of those contact situations that could maximize the potential for contact to reduce prejudice and promote positive intergroup outcomes. Ever since, explorations of contact theory have focused largely on positive factors. But the meta-analytic data reveal that the knowledge gained from past contact research is limited by its primary emphasis on positive features of the contact situation. Factors that curb contact's ability to reduce prejudice are now the most problematic theoretically, yet the least understood. These negative factors, ranging from intergroup anxiety (<a href="#c107">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</a>) to authoritarianism and normative restraints (<a href="#c88">Pettigrew, Wagner, Stellmacher, &amp; Christ, 2006</a>), deserve to become a major focus of future contact research. Such an emphasis would allow a more comprehensive understanding of conditions that both enhance and inhibit the potentially positive effects of contact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">New developments also suggest that the effects of these factors are likely to be moderated by the degree to which group membership is salient during contact. <a href="#c119">Voci and Hewstone (2003)</a> have shown that anxiety mediates the relationship between contact and prejudice when group salience is high but that such mediation is less pronounced when group salience is low.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Other studies have demonstrated that contact effects are more likely to generalize when group membership is salient (<a href="#c13">Brown &amp; Hewstone, 2005</a>). Indeed, this <a href="#c53">Hewstone and Brown (1986)</a> contention may explain why the meta-analytic results reveal such widespread generalization. It is likely that the demands of the contact research situation (or the need for reflection by those reporting on past contact) led to high group salience in most of the studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These advances raise the possibility of the development of a model considerably more complex and complete than Allport's original “contact hypothesis.” Contemporary research has examined a range of additional mediators of contact effects, including perspective taking (<a href="#c26">Craig, Cairns, Hewstone, &amp; Voci, 2002</a>), broadened views of the ingroup (e.g., <a href="#c42">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000</a>; <a href="#c86">Pettigrew, 1998</a>; <a href="#c101">Sherif, 1966</a>), and the perceived importance of the contact (<a href="#c115">Van Dick et al., 2004</a>). The search for mediators has also involved an expanded investigation of contact effects. Beyond the influence of contact on prejudice, researchers have tested the effects of intergroup contact on such variables as intergroup differentiation and outgroup variability (<a href="#c59">Islam &amp; Hewstone, 1993</a>; <a href="#c79">Oaker &amp; Brown, 1986</a>; <a href="#c81">Paolini et al., 2004</a>), ingroup pride (<a href="#c71">London &amp; Linney, 1993</a>), and a willingness to trust and forgive the outgroup (<a href="#c54">Hewstone et al., 2005</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given the current state of the research literature, there is little need to demonstrate further contact's general ability to lessen prejudice. Results from the meta-analysis conclusively show that intergroup contact can promote reductions in intergroup prejudice. Moreover, the meta-analytic findings reveal that contact theory applies beyond racial and ethnic groups to embrace other types of groups as well. As such, intergroup contact theory now stands as a general social psychological theory and not as a theory designed simply for the special case of racial and ethnic contact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Still, continued advances in understanding intergroup contact require more extensive longitudinal research. To date, findings from longitudinal studies typically have shown the persistence of the prejudice reduction achieved by contact (e.g., <a href="#c35">Eller &amp; Abrams, 2003</a>; <a href="#c66">Levin et al., 2003</a>). But such studies are rare. In addition to learning about the persistence of contact effects, it is necessary to determine the effects of long-term intergroup contact. Similar to mere exposure effects, we predict that, with continued contact, the reduction of prejudice would asymptote at some point and provide few further gains.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, more elaborate models are needed to integrate and account for these varied intergroup contact effects. Some such models have begun to emerge (e.g., <a href="#c13">Brown &amp; Hewstone, 2005</a>; <a href="#c42">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000</a>; <a href="#c86">Pettigrew, 1998</a>), many of which use complex structural models (e.g., <a href="#c35">Eller &amp; Abrams, 2003</a>; <a href="#c81">Paolini et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#c115">Van Dick et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#c119">Voci &amp; Hewstone, 2003</a>; <a href="#c120">Wagner et al., 2003</a>). For the future, multilevel models that consider both positive and negative factors in the contact situation, along with individual, structural, and normative antecedents of the contact, will greatly enhance researchers' understanding of the nature of intergroup contact effects. And as the contact literature continues to expand rapidly with rigorous methods and attention to theory, we anticipate that the future will witness the development of such comprehensive models of intergroup contact.</p><a id="psp-90-5-751-ID0EAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_221" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn1">1</a></sup> Many social psychologists would take issue with

measure were trichotomized: (a) the control group had no prior contact
or the sample used a within-subject design, (b) the control group had
some prior contact, or (c) the control group had extensive prior
contact with the outgroup.</p><a id="fn11" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn11">11</a></sup> Comparisons of samples with and without

selection bias involving the intergroup situations researchers choose
to study. But this type of situational selection bias appears highly
unlikely. Our file contains many studies, such as the examples just
described, where the contact situation is far less than optimal. More
important, most of the studies in this meta-analysis involve survey and
questionnaire research. Here, the subjects report on whatever
intergroup contact they have had. Thus, there is limited information
regarding the contact conditions, and the researchers had no control
over the situations involved.</p><a id="fn13" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn13">13</a></sup> Not all contact experiences are positive, of
course. Although most of the contact studies in our analysis focused on
positive contact outcomes, some recent work has shown that negative
intergroup experiences can enhance feelings of anxiety and threat and
hinder the development of positive orientations toward the outgroup
