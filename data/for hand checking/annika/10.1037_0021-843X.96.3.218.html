Two currently influential theories differ markedly in how they construe the cognitive processes underlying the production of hypnotic behavior. In his influential
<em>neodissociation</em>
theory,
<a href="#c5">Hilgard (1977</a>,
<a href="#c6">1979</a>) proposed that in hypnosis, the usual relations among the structures of a hierarchically organized cognitive control system are altered. The control structure at the apex of the hierarchy, designated as the executive ego and thought to be the seat of consciousness, is assumed to be capable, under normal circumstances, of monitoring and activating any one of a series of subordinate action control structures. In hypnosis, however, some of these substructures become dissociated from executive monitoring and control, although they can be activated directly by the hypnotist under these circumstances through suggestion. Because a dissociated substructure controls suggested responses in the absence of the executive ego's monitoring, hypnotized subjects experience their suggested responses as involuntary occurrences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to
<em>social role theory</em>
(<a href="#c13">Sarbin, 1950</a>; <a href="#c14">Sarbin &amp; Coe, 1972</a>,
<a href="#c15">1979</a>; <a href="#c17">Spanos, 1982</a>), a fundamentally different process is responsible for suggested behavior. Responsive hypnotic subjects are conceptualized as attempting to gear their overt as well as subjective responses to the contextual demands present in the hypnotic situation. The wording of test suggestions contributes a particularly potent source of demand. Such wording implies that suggested responses happen involuntarily (e.g., “Your arm is rising. It feels lighter and lighter …”). Subjects who are intent on meeting such demands fully must do more than make the requisite overt behavior. They must execute the behavior and generate the experience that the behavior is occurring involuntarily. In summary, social role theorists conceptualize hypnotic responding as strategic action. However, to meet demands fully during the test situation, subjects must create the impression (in themselves as well as in the hypnotist) that their responses are involuntary.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The purpose of this investigation is to use a novel assessment procedure to determine whether dissociation occurs under conditions that, according to neodissociation (<a href="#c5">Hilgard, 1977</a>,
<a href="#c6">1979</a>), are optimal for its occurrence. The hidden observer paradigm has been used extensively to assess dissociation (for reviews, see
<a href="#c6">Hilgard, 1979</a>; <a href="#c12">Nogrady, McConkey, Laurence, &amp; Perry, 1983</a>; <a href="#c17">Spanos, 1982</a>). The motor-resistance (<a href="#c4">Hilgard, 1963</a>; <a href="#c19">Spanos, Cobb, &amp; Gorassini, 1985</a>; <a href="#c23">Zamansky, 1977</a>) and task-interference (<a href="#c10">Knox, Crutchfield, &amp; Hilgard, 1975</a>; <a href="#c22">Stevenson, 1976</a>) paradigms have also been used for this purpose.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Subjects were requested to vocalize their ongoing thought while locating certain sentences in a textbook. First, the experimenter specified a sentence in terms of the page number on which it was printed, paragraph number on the page, and sentence number within the paragraph. Then, subjects were told to search for and locate the sentence. In waking subjects, this task would demand rehearsal (cf.
<a href="#c1">Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1971</a>) as a means of maintaining the relevant task information in short-term memory. Therefore, in carrying out the thought-vocalization exercise during their sentence searches, nondissociated subjects would most likely repeat aloud the page, paragraph, and sentence numbers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The sentence-location task was carried out under two treatment conditions. One treatment contained the features that, according to neodissociation theory, are optimal for a dissociation of cognitive controls (optimal features treatment). The sentence-location task was suggested (as opposed to instructed) to subjects of high hypnotic susceptibility who were administered a hypnotic induction procedure. The second treatment contained features that, according to neodissociation theory, mitigate against the occurrence of dissociation (mitigating features treatment). Here, the sentence location task was instructed (as opposed to suggested) to subjects of low susceptibility who were given no hypnotic induction.</p><a id="abn-96-3-218-ID0EDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Hypotheses">Hypotheses</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Neodissociation theory suggests the following: For subjects in the optimal features treatment, the rehearsal necessary for successful task regulation is carried out in the dissociated subsystem. Therefore, because the subsystem is dissociated from executive monitoring, there should be a lack of vocalized rehearsal and a lack of correspondence between any conscious rehearsal activity that occurs and actual location performance. In the mitigating features treatment, dissociation would not occur. Therefore, there should be relatively high levels of rehearsal, and the correspondence between rehearsal and location performance should be high. In short, the neodissociation formulation predicts much lower correspondence between conscious rehearsal and sentence-location performance under the optimal than under the mitigating conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The social role theory suggests that successful task regulation would demand conscious rehearsal in both treatments. Moreover, because conscious rehearsal is assumed to be the task-regulatory mechanism in both conditions, as much rehearsal-performance correspondence should occur under the optimal as under the mitigating conditions.</p><a id="abn-96-3-218-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_19" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="abn-96-3-218-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Subjects</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Twenty-four Bishop's University undergraduates pretested on the Carleton University Responsiveness to Suggestion Scale (

Upon entering the experimental room, subjects were seated at a small desk on which lay a green textbook entitled
<em>Verbal Learning</em>
(<a href="#c7">Jung, 1968</a>), and a clip-on microphone was attached to their collar.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Optimal features treatment</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The experimenter indicated that the session would involve hypnosis and invited any preliminary queries.
<a href="#c2">Barber's (1969)</a>
10-min hypnotic induction procedure was then administered via audiotape. After this, the experimenter introduced a suggestion phase:

<blockquote>In today's session some complex actions will be suggested. Each of the suggestions will declare that you find a sentence in the book on the desk in front of you, and once you have found it, to point to it. For example, it might be suggested that you will find and point to the first sentence in the second paragraph on page 27.</blockquote>
In addition subjects were requested to vocalize all of their ongoing thoughts in response to each suggestion: “Between the time when you are given the suggestion until you find and point to the sentence in the book, speak all of your thoughts aloud. Do not let one of your thoughts stay inside your head during this period.”</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To familiarize subjects with the task and to eliminate other practice-related effects, five practice trials were given. Each trial involved the presentation of a suggestion of the following form:

<blockquote>Imagine that your body is actually a machine whose one function is to locate particular sentences in the green book on the desk. The instant when I describe where in the book to find the sentence, your body will immediately search for, and then find, the sentence. Once found, your finger will point to the sentence.Your body will now find and point to the (sentence number) sentence in the (paragraph number) paragraph on page (page number).</blockquote>
Five different sentence-paragraph-page number triads were used, and their order was randomized before being presented to a subject. To avoid confusion that could occur if only part of a paragraph began a page, a new paragraph started each page on which a sentence was to be located.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Both speed and accuracy in locating a specified sentence were assessed on each trial. Speed was defined as the duration, in seconds, between the exact time a suggestion was completely uttered and the exact time the subject was observed to point decisively at a sentence. Accuracy was the degree to which the page, paragraph, and sentence numbers specified in a suggestion corresponded to the respective page, paragraph, and sentence numbers actually located by the subject. If the numbers corresponded exactly, an accuracy score of 3 was awarded; if two such numbers corresponded, a score of 2 was awarded, and so on. For example, if the experimenter suggested that the
<em>first</em>
sentence in the
<em>third</em>
paragraph on page 35 be located, and the subject actually pointed to the
<em>second</em>
sentence (noncorrespondence) in the
<em>third</em>
paragraph (correspondence) on page 35 (correspondence), two points were awarded because only the paragraph and the page numbers corresponded. Thus accuracy scores could vary from 0 to 3.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Subjects' vocalization during each practice trial was tape-recorded and later transcribed. Independent raters assessed each think-aloud report for evidence of rehearsal, defined as the utterance of at least one sentence, paragraph, or page number during the sentence search. Interrater agreement regarding the incidence of rehearsal was very high (<em>r</em>
= .98). The
<em>extent</em>
of rehearsal was estimated by simply counting the sentence, paragraph, or page numbers uttered on each trial. Consider the following example of a complete vocalization spoken in response to a suggestion to find the third sentence in the first paragraph on page 182: “Three, one, one-eighty-two … three, one … third sentence, first paragraph … there.” This report would receive a
<em>rehearsal score</em>
of 7 because a like number of sentence, paragraph, and page numbers were uttered.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Immediately following the fifth practice trial, the experimenter replaced the green textbook with a second textbook, silver in color and entitled
<em>Psychology of Perception</em>
(<a href="#c3">Dember, 1960</a>), to be used on three test trials. The change was made in order to give the subjects a ready means of discriminating between practice and test trials because following the experiment they would be asked about the thoughts and experiences that they had had at various times during the experiment. Three different sentence-paragraph-page triads were used during the test phase, and they were presented in counterbalanced order so that each of the six possible sequences was presented twice. Apart from the changes in method necessitated by the book switch, the procedure used during test trials was identical to that used during practice trials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Following the last test trial, the degree of involuntariness associated with search behavior was rated. Ratings were elicited for each of the test trial responses first:

<blockquote>Following the (suggestion number) “silver book” suggestion, I just found my body searching automatically for the sentence that was specified. I experienced this: (a) not at all (scored 0); (b) to a slight degree (scored 1); (c) to a moderate degree (scored 2); (d) to a great degree (scored 3). Remember, if you chose to find the sentence voluntarily, or if your body did not feel as if it was conducting the search for the sentence on its own, you should choose “Not at all.”</blockquote>
Following this, subjects used a similar rating scale to describe the involuntariness associated with their responses to each of the suggestions presented in the practice session. Thus an involuntariness score was derived for each test and practice trial for each subject. Once the involuntariness ratings were made, “hypnosis” was “canceled,” and subjects were debriefed and asked to refrain from discussing the experiment with anyone for 2 months.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Mitigating features treatment</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The experimenter indicated that the session would not involve hypnosis and invited any preliminary queries. Subjects were then asked to make themselves comfortable for a few minutes to allow the experimenter to make last minute preparations of equipment and questionnaires. Subjects were told that they should feel free to browse through any of the books on a nearby set of shelves. Then for a duration equal to that of the presentation of the hypnotic induction procedure administered in the optimal features treatment, the experimenter busied himself. Following this, he introduced the practice trials:

<blockquote>This experiment demands that you follow some fairly complex instructions. Each instruction asks you to find a sentence in the book in front of you, and once you have found it, to point to it. For example, you might be asked to find the first sentence in the second paragraph on page 27.</blockquote>
The same thought-vocalization instructions as presented in the optimal features treatment were then conveyed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Following this, the experimenter administered five practice trials and three test trials. On each trial, subjects were requested, in a direct fashion, to find a specified sentence: “Find and point to the (sentence number) sentence in the (paragraph number) paragraph on page (page number).” The textbooks and sentence-paragraph-page number triads used in the optimal features treatment were also used here. Speed and accuracy of performance as well as the incidence and extent of rehearsal were also assessed similarly. After subjects responded to the last test trial instruction, the experimenter administered the involuntariness rating questionnaire, which was similar to that administered in the optimal features treatment.</p><a id="abn-96-3-218-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_40" title="Results">Results</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="abn-96-3-218-ID0ECBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Manipulation Check</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to both the neodissociation and the social role theories, the optimal features treatment should have led to higher levels of experienced involuntariness than the mitigating features treatment. A 2 (treatment) × 5 (trial) unweighted means, mixed analysis of variance (

Post hoc analysis of these means (Tukey's honestly significant difference test) revealed two significant differences: Subjects reported experiencing greater involuntariness on Trial 5 than on either Trial 1 or Trial 2. A 2 (treatment) × 3 (trial)

Mean practice-trial accuracy scores averaged across treatments were, in order, 2.18, 2.75, 2.82, 2.60, and 2.61. Post hoc data analysis indicated a single significant mean difference in which sentence-locating accuracy was greater on Trial 3 than on Trial 1.

An error was defined as a lack of correspondence between the sentence, paragraph, or page number that the experimenter specified on a given trial and the one that the subject actually located. If, for example, the specified sentence was the
<em>first</em>
in the
<em>third</em>
paragraph on page 34, and the sentence actually located was the
<em>third</em>
in the
<em>first</em>
paragraph on page 34, the subject would have committed two errors because both the sentence and the paragraph numbers failed to correspond. In the optimal features treatment, 36 errors were committed (of 264 possible), representing a 13.64% error rate, whereas in the mitigating features treatment, 32 errors (of 288 possible) were committed, for an error rate of 11.11%. A
<em>t</em>
test indicated that the frequency of errors (summed across practice and test trials for each subject) in the two treatments was not significantly different (<em>p</em>

The rate of compliance with this request was extremely high. In the optimal features treatment, vocalization was exhibited on 87 of 88 trials, and in the mitigating features treatment on 95 of 96 trials. Two subjects, one in the mitigating features treatment and one in the optimal features treatment, exhibited a failure to vocalize. In both cases, the failure occurred on the first practice trial. Post-experimental questioning indicated that in both instances this was due to the fact that instructions had not been comprehended fully.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Every instance of think aloud involved at least some rehearsal.

Within the practice session, the mean rehearsal score (averaged over trials) in the optimal features treatment was 5.00, and within the mitigating features treatment, it was 3.73. Within the test session, mean rehearsal scores (also averaged over trials) under the optimal and mitigating conditions were 6.03 and 4.83, respectively.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In light of its theoretical importance, the relation between rehearsal and performance was assessed. In the dissociation view, suggested behavior is thought to be controlled by a dissociated control system. Therefore, the information processing that would be responsible for behavior regulation would occur outside of awareness. If this is correct, conscious rehearsal should have had little bearing on the actual location of sentences. Thus correspondence between sentence, paragraph, and page numbers reflected in thought reports, and those of sentences, paragraphs, and pages actually located, should have been greater in the mitigating features treatment than in the optimal features treatment. Correspondence was defined as the extent to which thought reports predicted the sentence, paragraph, and page numbers that subjects actually located. If, for example, on a given trial a thought report allowed correct prediction of the page and the paragraph numbers, but not the sentence number, a score of 2 out of a possible 3 was awarded on that trial. Independent raters were used to generate these predictions, with interrater agreement being high (<em>r</em>
= .97). Mean correspondence scores for practice and test trials appear in

Subjects in this condition may merely have been repeating the specified numbers at a conscious level while the dissociated control system, acting autonomously, was the actual source of regulation. In such an instance, the thought report would coincide with actual behavior but have no role in its regulation. A more rigorous test of the regulatory role of thought is reflected in an assessment of the degree to which thought reports predicted incorrect responses. In the case of incorrect responses, no external source of information would have been available to potentiate subjects' prediction of actions originating in a dissociated control system. Of the 36 errors made by hypnotic subjects on both practice and test trials, 11 (30.56%) could be predicted from thought reports, and of the 32 errors made by awake subjects, 11 (34.38%) were predictable on the basis of thought reports. A

The optimal features treatment contained components that, according to neodissociation theory, maximized the likelihood of dissociated control. Subjects were high in susceptibility, they were administered a hypnotic induction procedure, and their search task was conveyed via passively worded suggestions. Moreover, subjects in this group gave reports that were consistent with their having lost control over their own responding. They exhibited much higher rates of involuntary responding than did subjects in the mitigating features treatment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Despite all of this, the search behavior of subjects in the optimal features treatment provided no evidence for the occurrence of dissociation. No statistically significant differences between treatments occurred in (a) the amount of vocalized rehearsal, (b) the degree to which rehearsal predicted correct responses, or (c) the degree to which rehearsal predicted errors. These findings clearly indicate that search behavior was regulated by the “conscious executive.” A further implication of these data is that caution be exercised in interpreting the involuntariness reports of hypnotic subjects. Instead of being literal indications of how suggested responses are regulated, they more plausibly reflect misattributions that subjects make in the course of involved enactments of a role (<a href="#c20">Spanos &amp; Gorassini, 1984</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research underscores an interesting inconsistency in “hypnotic” subjects' self-presentational actions. Despite being intent on cultivating the impression that their behavior was involuntary, subjects in the optimal features treatment, in apparent contradition of their intentions, both vocalized their rehearsal strategy and exhibited consistency between their rehearsal and performance. One possible explanation for this is that an intention to create the impression of involuntariness need not logically subsume, for the subject, the same behaviors that would be assumed by the investigator to reflect involuntariness. Presumably, the subject would first have to possess the belief that use of cognitive strategies to guide behavior is an example of willfulness, and then he or she would have to engage in the cognitive work demanded in spelling out the implication that vocalizing a rehearsal strategy would vitiate the hypnotic likeness of the performance (cf.
<a href="#c16">Snyder, 1982</a>). Perhaps because of the short time allotted before a suggested response was to be exhibited, subjects had no opportunity to construct a more internally consistent performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The chief purpose of this investigation was to determine whether dissociation would occur under conditions that were considered optimal by the neodissociation theory for such an occurrence. The sentence-search paradigm could, however, also be used to assess the extent to which hypnotic susceptibility, preliminary information (i.e., whether a hypnotic induction procedure or waking instructions are administered at the beginning of the session), and message type (i.e., whether the sentence search is suggested or instructed), either individually or by their various interactions, would influence performance or experienced involuntariness. Another use is foreseen for the concurrent verbalization procedure in hypnotic research. There is some debate concerning the extent to which hypnotic amnesia and analgesia are the products of actively used attention diversion and reinterpretation strategies as opposed to passively occurring dissociation (<a href="#c8">Kihlstrom, 1978</a>; <a href="#c9">Kihlstrom, Easton, &amp; Shor, 1983</a>; <a href="#c11">Miller &amp; Bowers, 1986</a>; <a href="#c17">Spanos, 1982</a>,
