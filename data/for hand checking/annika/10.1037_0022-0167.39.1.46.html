What do they actually expect to accomplish? What activities do they anticipate will be helpful to them? How much time are they prepared to devote to the process? Despite years of research and practice, there is actually very little data about client expectations in career counseling. Yet, career counselors tend to behave as though “clients…enter such relationships with a clear set of expectations as to what will occur and the time span needed” (<a href="#c20">June &amp; Smith, 1983</a>, p. 598). Consequently expectations in career counseling has been an infrequent topic of study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, client expectations have been accorded an important role in personal counseling/psychotherapy and have been a major research focus for almost 40 years (for reviews see <a href="#c6">Duckro, Beal, &amp; George, 1979</a>; <a href="#c19">Higginbotham, West, &amp; Forsyth, 1988</a>; <a href="#c33">Tinsley, Bowman, &amp; Ray, 1988</a>; <a href="#c38">Wilkins, 1973</a>, <a href="#c39">1986</a>). Most of the early theoretical formulations about client expectations were made before 1962 (e.g., <a href="#c21">Kamm &amp; Wrenn, 1950</a>; <a href="#c30">Seeman, 1949</a>). <a href="#c22">Kelly (1955)</a> was one of the first to postulate a theoretical basis for the role of client expectations. According to Kelly, almost all clients hold a highly personalized conceptualization of the nature of the psychotherapy relationship and of the psychotherapist’s role within that relationship prior to the initiation of treatment. Kelly argued that the psychotherapist must accept the client’s preconception of the therapist’s role at least in the beginning stage of therapy. Failure to confirm the client’s expectations results in confusion or disappointment. Therefore, the therapist cannot ignore or reject the client’s anticipations, without risking negative effects, even though the therapist may attempt in the long run to change the role that the client initially accepts. Other researchers have agreed with Kelly’s basic formulation of the importance of client expectations and have offered various strategies for working with them in the therapeutic environment (<a href="#c5">Danskin, 1955</a>; <a href="#c27">Patterson, 1958</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Much of the early research on client expectations was reviewed and integrated in a classic work by <a href="#c10">Goldstein (1960</a>, <a href="#c11">1962)</a>. Goldstein identified two types of counseling expectations. <em>Prognostic expectations</em> involve assessments by the client, the counselor, or both of the probability that counseling will be successful. <em>Participant role expectations</em> consist of preconceived ideas of the client, the counselor, or both about what the participants will do and how they should behave toward each other during the process.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On the basis of his review of the available evidence, <a href="#c11">Goldstein (1962)</a> concluded that mutuality of participant role expectations has an important influence on counseling and psychotherapy. Goldstein believed that failure to confirm client expectations would result in negative consequences. This observation stimulated considerable research that was initially very supportive (e.g., <a href="#c8">Frank, Gliedman, Imber, Nash, &amp; Stone, 1957</a>; <a href="#c17">Heine &amp; Trosman, 1960</a>; <a href="#c24">Lennard &amp; Bernstein, 1960</a>); as a result, the impact of disconfirmed client expectancies is widely accepted, even today. On the other hand, much of the post-1962 research either failed to support the presumed effects of disconfirmed client expectancies or was equivocal. For example, <a href="#c7">Fiester (1974)</a> found no relationship between disconfirmed client expectations of the therapist role and dropping out of psychotherapy, and <a href="#c37">Volsky, Magoon, Norman, and Hoyt (1965)</a> found no evidence that clients’ expectations about their role, the therapist’s role, or other aspects of the therapy process have an important bearing on psychotherapy outcome in general. In summarizing the results of the studies conducted after 1962, <a href="#c6">Duckro et al. (1979)</a> reported that 21 studies (49%) supported the hypothesized relationship and 22 studies (51%) did not.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In attempts to reconcile these contradictory findings, researchers have identified a variety of conceptual and methodological problems as hampering counseling/psychotherapy expectation research. One of the most important is the ambiguous nature of the expectation construct. Several authors (e.g., <a href="#c6">Duckro et al., 1979</a>; <a href="#c13">Grantham &amp; Gordon, 1986</a>) have stressed the need to differentiate between expectation as the <em>anticipation</em> of an event and expectation as the <em>preference</em> for an event, noting that the two usages frequently have been confounded in previous research. For example, <a href="#c13">Grantham and Gordon (1986)</a> stated the following:

<blockquote>Expectation as anticipation and expectation as preference are different aspects of human cognition that warrant distinct treatment. Tinsley and Benton (1978) and Tinsley, Workman, and Kass (1980) emphasized expectancy in their work and used the terms expectancy, expectations, and preferences interchangeably. In so doing, they destroyed the distinction that theorists have been trying to draw for the last 30 years. (p. 397)</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a result of this common tendency to confuse preferences with anticipations or to use a more general expectation or expectancy construct, researchers did not attempt to untangle the constructs until <a href="#c36">VandeCreek and Angstadt’s (1985)</a> study of self-disclosure. “<a href="#c6">Duckro et al. (1979)</a> suggested that anticipation and preference may be interacting variables, with preferences being more important, but no research has evaluated this” (<a href="#c36">VandeCreek &amp; Angstadt, 1985</a>, p. 207). Thus, empirical researchers (<a href="#c35">Tracey &amp; Dundon, 1988</a>; <a href="#c36">VandeCreek &amp; Angstadt, 1985</a>) have only recently confirmed the value of a preference–anticipation distinction, supporting the use of separate preference and anticipation constructs in lieu of a single counseling expectation construct.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As noted by <a href="#c35">Tracey and Dundon (1988)</a>, measurement problems have also plagued client-expectation research and have added to the conceptual confusion. Among these measurement issues is the lack of sound psychometric support for the instruments used and construction of instruments on the basis of nonclient samples (e.g., <a href="#c34">Tinsley, Workman, &amp; Kass, 1980</a>). One of the most surprising and fundamental measurement issues, however, has been researchers’ failure to gather expectational data from the expector’s (the client’s) perspective, a problem that has been noted by <a href="#c12">Goldstein (1981)</a> and <a href="#c19">Higginbotham et al. (1988)</a>. Thus, rather than soliciting information about preferences and anticipations directly from the client through an open-ended, participant–observer approach, previous research has tended to involve fixed-format questionnaires, which impose the researcher’s perspective. Although such formats have the advantage of scoring ease, they result in expectation data, which may be based more on the researcher’s than the client’s phenomenological perspective. Given that the goal of this research is to determine the career client’s preferences and anticipations, that is, the two components of expectations, such a restriction of client responses appears to be both unwarranted and undesirable, especially in the early phases of research (<a href="#c12">Goldstein, 1981</a>; <a href="#c19">Higginbotham et al., 1988</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A final concern, which is somewhat beyond the scope of this investigation, is the questionable validity of the unidimensional theory of reactions to disconfirmed expectations. This theory undergirds much of the early research. <a href="#c18">Helson (1964)</a> challenged this view by positing a bipolar theory of the way in which client expectations affect the process. Helson’s position not only accounts for the intensity of expectancy discrepancies but also accounts for the direction of the discrepancy. Helson deduced that given a particular affectively toned expectation, if the event that actually occurs is more desirable than the expected event, the result will be positive affect and approach motivation. Conversely, if the actual event is less desirable than the expected event, the result will be negative affect and avoidance motivation. Helson’s views were a precursor to the view of expectations as a two-dimensional construct composed of anticipations and preferences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the role of expectations in career counseling per se has not been widely studied, some research has been conducted on this topic. A review of the few existing studies is instructive. First, in a study that failed to distinguish between preference and anticipations, <a href="#c9">Gladstein (1969)</a> investigated the educational and vocational expectations of high school clients. Although fewer clients reported receiving help in choosing a vocation and in career planning than wanted help, satisfaction with counseling was reduced only for clients who reported having none of their expectations met. However, Gladstein questioned the validity of the latter finding on the basis of lack of variability on the satisfaction measure. In addition, he called for a less structured approach to measurement of expectations in future research, noting that “our current beliefs about client expectations may be in error due to predetermined categories” (<a href="#c9">Gladstein, 1969</a>, p. 480).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Other career counseling expectation research has had a somewhat more limited focus. In a group of studies in which nonclients participated as subjects, researchers have investigated preferences as a function of counselor gender (<a href="#c2">Boulware &amp; Holmes, 1970</a>; <a href="#c16">Hardin &amp; Yanico, 1983</a>; <a href="#c23">Lee, Hallberg, Jones, &amp; Haase, 1980</a>; <a href="#c26">Mezzano, 1971</a>; <a href="#c40">Yanico &amp; Hardin, 1985</a>), with the most common finding being that male counselors are preferred over female counselors for vocational concerns.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In other research, <a href="#c20">June and Smith (1983)</a> compared client and counselor expectations regarding duration of counseling. Both clients and counselors expected career counseling to involve significantly fewer interviews than either personal/social counseling or a combination of career and personal/social counseling. Moreover, clients consistently gave significantly lower estimates than did counselors for all types of counseling (e.g., for career counseling, the clients’ mean estimate was 2.03 sessions, and the counselor’s mean estimate was 3.54 sessions).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With a nonclient sample, <a href="#c16">Hardin and Yanico (1983)</a> found no differences as a function of problem type (vocational vs. personal) on the Expectations About Counseling (EAC) questionnaire (<a href="#c34">Tinsley et al., 1980</a>). <a href="#c15">Hardin, Subich, and Holvey (1988)</a> reported no significant differences on the EAC between premature and appropriate counseling terminators as a function of problem type (career vs. personal). However, these authors, as well as others (e.g., <a href="#c19">Higginbotham et al., 1988</a>; <a href="#c35">Tracey &amp; Dundon, 1988</a>), questioned the adequacy of the EAC as a measure of precounseling expectations. As noted above, the limitations of the EAC include the fact that it confounds preferences and anticipations and the fact that it was developed on a nonclient sample.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><blockquote>A third question raised…is the adequacy of the EAC.… Results of one recent study (Prospero, 1987) suggested that the short form of the EAC might, in fact, be a measure of global positive or negative set toward counseling rather than a number of discrete expectations.… It would be useful to replicate these results with the long form of the EAC or to develop a more sophisticated measure of precounseling expectations. (Hardin et al., 1988, pp. 39–40)</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, it appears that little is known about the role of precounseling preferences and anticipations in career counseling and that generalization of findings from previous research with personal counseling or psychotherapy clients is unwarranted. Given the rather rudimentary state of knowledge in this area, the purpose of this study was to provide some preliminary data about the precounseling expectations of career clients. Moreover, we attempted to draw on some of the methodological improvements gleaned from the findings of almost 40 years of personal counseling expectations research. Specifically, we used an open-ended rather than a forced-choice questionnaire format to collect information from college students immediately before their initial career counseling interview. The open-ended format allowed each client to provide his or her unique perspective rather than having to respond from the investigators’ perspective. Second, rather than containing references to a generic expectation construct, the questionnaire asked clients to respond to the more precise notions of anticipations, preferences, and dislikes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We attempted to answer some basic questions about expectations and career counseling. The types of questions include the following: (a) What do clients want (prefer) from career counseling? What process and methods do they want to be used in the session? How long do they want the career counseling to take?; (b) What do clients anticipate will be the outcome of career counseling? What do they think the process will actually be like? What methods do they think will be used? and How long do they think the career counseling will actually take?; (c) What do clients dislike in career counseling?; (d) Are career client’s preferences and anticipations congruent?; and (e) Do the preferences and anticipations of clients who have had previous counseling experience differ from those who have not?</p><a id="cou-39-1-46-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_24" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="cou-39-1-46-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The participants were students who sought career counseling at the counseling center of a large southeastern university during the latter part of the fall semester and the first half of the spring semester of one academic year. The group consisted of 22 (24%) men and 70 (76%) women, a total of 92 participants. Statistics kept by the center indicated that the ratio of men to women in the study was similar to the percentage of male (27%) and female (73%) clients seen during the year.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Eleven (12%) of the participants were freshmen, 28 (30%) were sophomores, 22 (24%) were juniors, 17 (18%) were seniors, and 13 (14%) were graduate students. One (1%) participant did not specify year in school. The mean age of the sample was 21.71 years, with a range of 18–41 years. Eighty-eight (96%) were White, and 4 (4%) were Black or of other ethnicity. The primary career concerns for which the participants sought counseling were the following: career indecision (48.9%), selecting a major (18.5%), both selecting a major and career indecision (28.3%), and other career concerns (4.3%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">No special advertisement or other form of recruitment was done by the counseling center for the study. In general, the center publicizes the full range of its services through several methods including disseminating information about the centers during freshmen orientation, contributing occasional articles in the student newspaper (about once or twice a semester), and sending announcements to resident hall advisors. Counseling center statistics on referral sources for clients seen during the year indicated that half are referred by either other students (34%) or advisers and faculty members (16%). When asked to respond on a 7-point scale ranging from <em>entirely my own idea</em> (1) to <em>entirely the idea of others</em> (7) regarding who influenced their decision to come to the center, 87% of these participants gave answers in the 1–4 range, with 35.9% indicating that it was entirely their idea (a score of 1), and 23.9% indicating that they were equally influenced by themselves and others (a score of 4).</p><a id="cou-39-1-46-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All students who requested career counseling during the period of this study were asked to participate and to complete an open-ended questionnaire developed by the investigators. The questionnaire was completed immediately before the initial counseling interview. Of the first 67 career clients attending the counseling center from the time the study began, 54 (79%) agreed to participate in the study. Data regarding participation rates inadvertently were not kept for subsequent clients but were believed to be comparable to the percentage for the initial period.</p><a id="cou-39-1-46-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Instrument</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On the basis of a review of the literature, discussions with career counselors at the counseling center, and pilot testing, we designed an open-ended, paper-and-pencil questionnaire, the survey of career counseling preferences and anticipations (SCCPA), to assess clients’ precounseling preferences and anticipations regarding career counseling. In addition to assessing basic demographic data and information on previous counseling experience, the SCCPA contained 15 open-ended questions divided into five sections: (a) number of sessions (2 questions), (b) what the client (3 questions) and the counselor (3 questions) would do during the sessions, (c) what would occur between the sessions (3 questions), (d) the outcome or goal of counseling (2 questions), and (e) the role of testing (2 questions). Each section contained one question about preferences and a similar question about anticipations. The sections dealing with what the client and counselor would do during sessions and what would occur between sessions also contained questions about dislikes. The following is an example from the section about client expectations during sessions, illustrating a preference question, an anticipation question, and a dislike question, respectively: “What in particular would you <strong>LIKE</strong> to do <u>during</u> the counseling sessions?” (preference); “What types of things do you <strong>THINK</strong><u>you</u> will be required to do <u>during</u> the counseling sessions?” (anticipation); “What would you <strong>DISLIKE</strong> doing <u>during</u> the counseling sessions?” (dislike).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because of the open-ended format of the SCCPA, participants frequently responded to the survey items with more than one answer and used various forms of grammatical diction. To evaluate these data in a standard way, each participant’s response to each question was divided into units that could be scored (i.e., unitized) so that the responses could be coded into discrete response categories (i.e., scored). We established general guidelines for unitizing multiple responses on the basis of standard grammatical syntax (<a href="#c4">Curme, 1947</a>; <a href="#c25">Mallery, 1967</a>; <a href="#c31">Shaw, 1978</a>) and consensus of the research team. Survey responses were considered multiple responses and unitized if at least one of the following criteria was satisfied: (a) Phrases were separated by a mark of punctuation (e.g., comma, period, semicolon, colon, hyphen, slash) or coordinating conjunction; (b) responses were listed on a separate line and were not the continuation of a clause, phrase, or sentence; and (c) phrases contained new verbs (e.g., “Take tests…explore majors”). We developed the unitization guidelines with the data of about one quarter of the participants for each question and then cross-checked for adequacy on the data of approximately another quarter of the participants. We then computed interrater agreement for unitization procedures on the responses of the remaining participants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two independent raters unitized the responses. They agreed on the unitization of 1,055 of 1,116 responses for an overall agreement rate of 94.3%. It should be emphasized that this percent-of-agreement figure was based on common ratings of a portion of the participants for each question rather than on the entire set of participants. The entire final data set consisted of 1,546 responses from the 92 participants; however, as mentioned previously, data from some participants were not used to calculate interrater agreement rate because they were used in the initial phases to develop and cross-check the unitization guidelines. Items of rater disagreement were discussed by the entire research team for final consensus on proper unitization. All subsequent coding (scoring) of participant responses was conducted with the corrected, retyped unitized survey responses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We developed response scoring (coding) systems for each of 13 questions (5 preference, 5 anticipation, and 3 dislike questions) through a systematic, labor-intensive procedure of iterations. (The 2 questions on number of counseling sessions anticipated and preferred did not require a coding system.) We followed these procedures: For each of the 13 questions, the participants’ data were divided roughly into halves. Approximately one quarter of the data was then used to develop a response category system for a given question, and another quarter of the data for that question was subsequently used to cross-check the adequacy of that scoring system. Development of the scoring system, which usually involved 3–7 iterations for each question, was conducted in the following manner: One or two of us read approximately one quarter of the responses and attempted to reduce the number of categories through content analyses, with a minimum of inference on our part, to a smaller set of categories that represented the range of participant responses. Each scoring system was repeatedly refined until it contained a set of definitions and examples, which were then cross-checked for applicability on approximately the second quarter of the responses for each question. The remaining half of the data was then used to obtain an estimate of the interrater reliability for the scoring system as it was used by two trained independent raters who were members of the research team.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To the extent that participant responses permitted, we made an attempt to develop comparable scoring systems for each matched preference and anticipation question. As an example, the following scoring categories were used for rating answers to the questions, “What do you <strong>HOPE</strong> that you might learn from any tests that you might take in career counseling?” (preference) and “What information do you actually <strong>THINK</strong> the tests will provide you?” (anticipation): (a) blank, “?”, “don’t know”, “not sure”; (b) career/person match in which specific career/major is identified or confirmed for an individual; involves the use of tests for matching or confirmation; (c) use of test to narrow or broaden options, get direction, or evaluate options; (d) greater understanding of self (unspecified); (e) identify strengths/weaknesses; (f) identify aptitudes/skills; (g) identify personality attributes; (h) identify interests; and (i) miscellaneous/unclassifiable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two independent raters coded each of the corrected, unitized responses for each question. A total of 1,110 responses were coded in common. Exact agreement on coding category was obtained for 957 responses, for a total agreement of 86.2%. As mentioned previously, these percent-of-agreement figures are estimates based on common ratings for a portion of the participants rather than for all participants. Thus, those participants whose data were used to develop the coding categories were not included when calculating the percent-of-agreement figure. After interrater agreement was obtained, discrepant ratings were resolved by a third rater prior to data analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Before analyzing the data, all multiple instances of a particular response category for a given participant on a question were eliminated. For example, if a participant gave two responses indicating “identify interests” to the question about what he or she hoped to learn from the tests, only one instance of that response category was counted. This procedure was adopted so as not to overrepresent the category in the data. However, a participant could be credited with more than one response category for a particular question. For example, a participant could answer “identify interests” and “identify personality attributes” to the question about tests. These procedures yielded 1,546 total response for the 92 participants on the 13 questions. These 1,546 responses constituted the data set that was subjected to statistical analyses.</p><a id="cou-39-1-46-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_44" title="Results">Results</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">First we present results for the entire sample.

Two more specific outcomes, career choice or confirmation (22.8%) and major choice or confirmation (18.5%), and a somewhat more general outcome, list of career possibilities (16.3%), were, respectively, the next three most frequent responses.

Don’t know response were more frequent for anticipated (52.2%) than preferred (26.1%) between-session activities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Testing</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Through testing, clients hoped (preferences) to acquire a personal match with a major or a career: career/person match (48.9%). In addition, they wanted to narrow or broaden options (15.2%), identify strengths and weaknesses (14.2%) and identify interests (12.0%). Other preferred outcomes of testing were don’t know (10.9%), miscellaneous/unclassifiable (9.8%), identify aptitudes/skills (8.7%), gain greater understanding of self (4.3%), and identify personality attributes (4.3%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, responses (anticipations) of 20.7% of the clients indicated that they did not know what they would learn from testing; another 20.7% indicated that they anticipated that they would identify interests. Only 18.5% anticipated a career/person or career/major match, and another 17.4% gave miscellaneous/unclassifiable responses. Less frequent anticipations included the following: narrow or broaden options (16.3%), identify strengths and weaknesses (14.1%), identify aptitudes/skills (4.3%), identify personality attributes (4.3%), and gain understanding of self (3.3%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The McNemar tests revealed two significant findings out of nine analyses. First, clients desired career/person or major/person matches from testing to a greater degree than they anticipated achieving them (48.9% vs. 18.5%). In addition, don’t know responses were given more often to the question of what clients anticipated from testing (20.7%) than to the question of what they hoped to achieve (10.9%) from testing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Dislikes</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Clients were also surveyed with respect to their dislikes in career counseling. Don’t know was the most frequent response (35.9%) for what they would dislike doing during counseling. The next most frequent disliked activities referred to dissatisfaction with counselor style, for example, too evasive or too pressuring, (15.2%) and discussing topics that the client viewed as unrelated to career counseling (13.0%). Other dislikes were miscellaneous/unclassifiable (13.0%), not completing activities or goals the client wanted to achieve (12%), discussing topics related to career counseling but not of interest to the client (9.8%), and making decisions too quickly (3.3%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Responses to disliked counselor activities include don’t know (40.2%), demonstrating a lack of understanding, respect, and openness (31.5%), and a passive, vague, or nondirective style that wastes time (13.0%). Other disliked counselor behaviors were the following: providing information that is too general or irrelevant (8.7%), pressuring or forcing specific strategies on the client (6.5%), miscellaneous/unclassifiable responses (6.5%), and refusing or failing to use a particular technique of interest to the client (1.1%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Responses to disliked activities between counseling sessions included a high percentage of don’t know (53.3%), other (15.2%), and miscellaneous/unclassifiable (13.2) responses. Other dislikes were reading activities (6.5%), writing activities (6.5%), information interviewing or meeting people (4.3%), actually seeking or interviewing for a job (4.3%), seminars (3.3%), and tests (2.2%).</p><a id="cou-39-1-46-ID0EBBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Differences by Gender</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although it was not a major focus of the study, we also investigated the possibility of differences in the data as a function of gender. However, because of the relatively small number of men in the sample, the overall ratio of men to women, and the number of tests run, these results must be regarded as extremely tentative at best. As such, the number of significant results is reported rather than the nature of specific differences. This procedure is adopted as a way to suggest the potential relative importance of gender differences to preferences and anticipation in career counseling and to avoid overemphasizing particular gender-difference findings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first set of analyses involved chi-square tests on the preference, anticipation, and dislike responses, respectively, for men and women. Each test was a 2 (male vs. female)×2 (presence of a response in the response category vs. absence of a response in the response category) and involved one degree of freedom. Only five significant findings (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) were found of 118 tests performed on the response categories (47 preferences, 46 anticipations, 25 dislikes), suggesting that gender differences may not play a prominent role with respect to preferences, anticipations, and dislikes in career counseling.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As with the total sample, we also investigated, using McNemar tests, the extent to which preferences and anticipations matched each other according to gender. These tests were run within gender. The results, which indicated only one significant (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) preference–anticipation mismatch for men of 45 tests but 20 significant mismatches of 45 for women, suggest that gender differences are likely to be found not in preferences and anticipations per se but in the degree to which preferences and anticipations are in harmony in career counseling for men and for women.</p><a id="cou-39-1-46-ID0EABCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Effects of Previous Counseling</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We investigated whether individuals who have had previous counseling differ from those who have not in their preferences and anticipations and in the degree of correspondence between those preferences and anticipations. Because of small sample size, the participants who had previous personal counseling or previous career counseling were combined into a single previous-counseling group (<em>n</em> = 36) versus the no-counseling group (<em>n</em> = 53). Three participants did not provide information on previous counseling and were not included in these analyses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We explored differences between the two groups on preferences, anticipations, and dislikes by chi-square tests of independent proportions corrected for continuity, with alpha set at .05. Results indicated few differences between the groups, with the number of significant differences not exceeding the numbers that would be expected by chance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To determine whether the degree of match between preferences and anticipations varied as a function of previous counseling experience, we ran McNemar tests on the most frequent preferences and anticipations. Twenty-six tests were run within each group, revealing eight significant preference–anticipation mismatches within the previous counseling group and nine significant mismatches within the no-counseling group. Of the mismatches for the two groups, five were on the same (common) variables and in the same direction for the two groups and therefore not reported.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Thus, only a few dissimilar preference–anticipation mismatches occurred as a function of previous counseling experience. For the previous counseling group, the three significant remaining mismatches included the following: (a) clients’ not anticipating gaining new information about majors and careers during counseling as much as they wanted to gain such information; (b) clients’ anticipating that they would have to take tests more than they wanted to take tests; and (c) more don’t know responses for what the clients anticipated from testing as compared to what they wanted from testing. For the no-counseling group, the four remaining significant mismatches were the following: (a) hoping to confirm a career choice but not as frequently as anticipating to do so; (b) clients’ anticipating that they would have to engage in good client behaviors more than they would like to engage in such behaviors; (c) clients’ preferring counselor advice but less frequently anticipating receiving it; and (d) client’s preferring to be involved in internship or hands-on career experience between sessions but less frequently anticipating such involvement.</p><a id="cou-39-1-46-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_96" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of this study suggest several conclusions. First, clients have fairly clear ideas about what they wanted (preferences from career counseling and about what the experience should be like. According to clients’ preferences, career counseling should take about three sessions. It should result either in a clearer sense of direction about career/major or in confirming one’s choice of career/major, with these goals being facilitated, in part, through testing. Moreover, the process should focus on specific career plans and decision making and on exploring both careers and oneself, with the counselor as an active, knowledgeable participant who gives advice and uses counseling techniques to facilitate decision making. Between counseling sessions, clients want to be involved in reading and doing research on careers and in interviewing people in various careers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, clients are somewhat less certain about what career counseling will actually be like (anticipations) and are less optimistic about it. Although they anticipate that it will take three sessions, they see career counseling as less frequently resulting in the sense of career/major direction than they would like to obtain and often as yielding only a list of possibilities. They view the process as being concerned primarily with exploring self and taking tests, with the latter providing information of uncertain value or information that has more to do with one’s interests than confirming a match between personal qualities and choice of career or major. Many clients seem to be saying that they know what they would prefer to accomplish in career counseling, but they harbor doubts about being able to do so. Thus, they prefer to focus on career direction and decision making but anticipate focusing on self-exploration and assessment. Furthermore, clients are either uncertain about how the counselor will interact with them or see the counselor as using various counseling techniques in an unspecified way to facilitate the process. Finally, clients appear to be uncertain about what career-related activities they will be asked to engage in between sessions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, when preferences and anticipations are considered in combination, a number of significant mismatches are evident. These mismatches suggest that clients anticipate accomplishing less of what they most prefer to accomplish and achieving more of the goals and activities that are least preferred. For example, clients want to confirm their choice of major or career to a much greater extent than they anticipate actually doing so. Similarly, clients want to discuss career plans and decision making significantly more than they believe they will, but they anticipate having to explore self, take tests, and engage in good client behavior significantly more than they would like.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fourth, clients’ precounseling responses suggest that they do not have well-developed expectations about their dislikes in career counseling. This finding probably reflects the fact that clients have insufficient knowledge about the career counseling process to have established a clear set of dislikes at this point.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fifth, in comparing clients who have had previous counseling to those who have not, almost no differences are evident with respect to both precounseling preferences and precounseling anticipations. However, when preference–anticipation mismatches are considered, a few different mismatches are evident for participants with previous counseling as compared to those without.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Many studies have investigated client expectations of the therapist’s role in personal counseling and psychotherapy (e.g., <a href="#c1">Apfelbaum, 1958</a>; <a href="#c29">Rickers-Ovsiankina, Berzins, Geller, &amp; Rogers, 1971</a>; <a href="#c32">Thomas, Polansky, &amp; Kounin, 1955</a>). <a href="#c35">Tracey and Dundon (1988)</a> labeled some of the more common role dimensions from these studies as approval seeking (being taken care of), advice seeking (being straightened out), audience seeking (being helped to help oneself), and relationship seeking (being autonomous and equal to the counselor).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We found less variety in the role expectations of career clients. The preferred counselor role in career counseling is predominantly an advising role that includes facilitating self-exploration and decision making. Perhaps the fairly specific goals of career counseling, as compared with the more amorphous process and outcomes of personal counseling/psychotherapy, result in less diversity in preferred counselor roles.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present study, there were substantial similarities between the clients’ preferences and their anticipations for career counseling. On 26 of the 45 comparisons, the clients’ preferences and anticipations were similar. Nevertheless, the number of mismatches supports the practice of evaluating anticipations and preferences independently. Similar to the clients described by <a href="#c35">Tracey and Dundon (1988)</a> who enter personal counseling, career clients enter counseling having already made distinctions between what they would like ideally and what they think they can realistically attain in counseling.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c19">Higginbotham et al. (1988)</a> suggested that clients with prior experience in counseling “may have better defined and more sharply focused expectancies, and be more confident of these expectancies, than first time clients” (p. 142). One possible manifestation of more sharply focused expectations might be fewer discrepancies between preferences and anticipations about the counseling process. Our analysis, however, did not find a differing number of discrepancies between the experienced and inexperienced groups. The number of preference–anticipation mismatches was roughly equal (9 vs. 10) in each group.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Discussing implications for practice on the basis of the results of an exploratory study such as this one seems some-what premature. However, several suggestions, many of which are implicit in the previous paragraphs, seem worthy of consideration. Specifically, it might be more prudent strategically to discuss what clients would like (prefer) from career counseling before discussing what they can legitimately expect (anticipate) from it. This suggestion is reminiscent of <a href="#c22">Kelly’s (1955)</a> notion of accepting the client’s personalized conceptualization of psychotherapy initially even though it may need to be reshaped later. Thus, educating clients about what they can legitimately expect from career counseling and about the actual process are two strategies that are likely to increase satisfaction, or minimize potential dissatisfaction, but they may need to be implemented gradually. A few additional techniques are also implied by the results of this study. For example, discussing the need for some self-exploration prior to decision making and discussing the value and limits of interest inventories and other vocational tests seem to be two important but relatively simple counseling interventions that should be used routinely. In general, the strategies suggested from this study have the potential either for reducing the uncertainty and lack of knowledge that participants report experiencing about career counseling or for providing an acceptable rationale for engaging in less preferred but much needed career counseling activities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, this study has several limitations. Notably, we studied career clients from one counseling center and asked a unique set of questions in a unique format. With respect to format, in asking about preferences and anticipations, one must invariably ask about one of these constructs prior to asking about the other. The implication of this procedure is that the results obtained through asking about preferences before anticipations may not be equivalent to those that would be obtained if the order were reversed. In each case, the results may be valid but may not be generalizable to the opposite order. The order in which preference and anticipation data are obtained represents an important external validity question (<a href="#c3">Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963</a>) that merits investigation. However, it is a much less serious concern than the internal validity issue of confounding preference and anticipation in a single expectation construct, which has plagued this area of research for almost 40 years. Nevertheless, the results from this study may not be applicable to other client populations and may not be comparable to other studies that involve different questions and different response formats or orders. Furthermore, the exploratory nature of the study precluded describing the process and outcome expectations (preferences and anticipations) with much precision or quantification. The exploratory nature of the study also resulted in running a large number of statistical tests, with the increased possibility of Type I error. Thus the findings should be viewed with caution until they have been replicated. Finally, the sample size and composition was not large or diverse enough to permit an adequate analysis of potential gender differences or race differences, which need to be investigated in future research. Despite these limitations, this study contributes to the identification, from the client’s perspective, of the significant dimensions of the process and outcome expectations for career counseling, a topic that, to our knowledge, has not been studied previously.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In sum, clients’ anticipations and preferences for career counseling are related but different enough to require that they be assessed independently. Clients prefer and anticipate a similar outcome: clarification of a career or major direction. They prefer a task-focused process but anticipate a person-focused process. Clients appear somewhat skeptical of the value of testing, even though many of them believe that testing will be a required part of career counseling. They seem to have a better idea of what they hope (prefer) will occur during counseling than what they expect (anticipate) to occur. Clients clearly enter career counseling anticipating discrepancies between what they prefer to achieve and what they will actually achieve. The impact of those preference–anticipation mismatches on career counseling process and outcome is an important area for further investigation.</p><a id="cou-39-1-46-ID0E0IB0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_111" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Apfelbaum, B.
