We also thank Effie Hoestis for preparing the illustrations used in the experiment; John Lampinen for playing the role of the adult Anthony; Anthony Maratea for playing the role of little Anthony; Anthony's mother, Linda Maratea, for her help in obtaining Anthony's cooperation; and Linda Lampinen for her help in filming the Anthony sequences. We would also like to thank the parents, teachers, and children at all the preschools who participated in this research, especially Lois Fisher at Child Care With Confidence, Beth Ericson at Wee Care Children's Center, Susan Fahey at Children's Care and Development, Becky Birham at Crayon Campus, Elaine Leiberman at Albany Park Preschool, and Dorothy Lombardo at Children's Campus. Sandra Waxman gave us helpful advice on obtaining participants for this experiment, and Laura Namy provided helpful suggestions at other stages of this project.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When eyewitness testimony is presented as evidence against a defendant, reasonable questions can be asked about the accuracy of the witness's recollections. When the witness is a child, accuracy concerns intensify. Can children adequately process, retain, recall, and report events? Two competing views of children have fueled the debate over this issue. On the one hand, children are perceived as innocent and truthful; on the other hand, they are viewed as suggestible and prone to fantasy (see <a href="#c15">Goodman, 1984a</a>, <a href="#c16">1984b</a>; <a href="#c32">Ross, Dunning, Toglia, &amp; Ceci, 1990</a>).
Because of concerns about children's accuracy, courts have developed special procedures for dealing with child witnesses. Some states specify that children under a certain age are presumed to be incompetent to testify, unless their competence can be demonstrated in a pretrial hearing before a judge (<a href="#c20">Leippe &amp; Romanczyk, 1989</a>; <a href="#c31">Perry &amp; Wrightsman, 1991</a>).
Questioning techniques may also be modified for child witnesses. Both legal experience and psychological evidence indicate that young children's free recall of an event can be quite accurate, but their recall tends to contain little detail (<a href="#c11">Cole &amp; Loftus, 1987</a>; <a href="#c28">Marin, Holmes, Guth, &amp; Kovac, 1979</a>).
As a result, gaining a complete account of an event from a child may require asking specific and even leading questions. The <a href="#c14">Federal Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates (1979, Rule 611C)</a>, which generally prohibit the use of leading questions, have recognized an exception to this prohibition when the witness is a child.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Permitting leading questions of child witnesses may reduce the problems created by children's sparse recall, but such questioning raises additional concerns about the accuracy of the resulting testimony. A questioner asking a leading question may inadvertently ask a misleading question—a question that suggests an incorrect answer. Considerable research has demonstrated that misleading questions impair eyewitnesses' accuracy (e.g., <a href="#c2">Belli, 1989</a>, <a href="#c3">1993</a>; <a href="#c4">Bowers &amp; Bekerian, 1984</a>; <a href="#c9">Christiaansen, Sweeney, &amp; Ochalek, 1983</a>; <a href="#c22">Loftus, 1975</a>, <a href="#c23">1977</a>, <a href="#c24">1979</a>).
These impairments occur for both adult and child witnesses, with young children being especially susceptible to influence by misleading information (<a href="#c6">Ceci &amp; Bruck, 1993b</a>).
The present research investigated in child witnesses one potential moderating factor that is known to influence adults, namely the credibility of the source of the misleading information (<a href="#c12">Dodd &amp; Bradshaw, 1980</a>; <a href="#c17">Greene, Flynn, &amp; Loftus, 1982</a>; <a href="#c33">Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1987</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Misleading postevent information experiments typically involve three stages. In the first stage, participants witness some event, which usually is presented on slides or videotape or is staged live. After a retention interval, there is a second stage, in which participants are presented with misleading or unbiased information about the event. The misleading information may be an incorrect presupposition embedded in a question or an erroneous detail included in a narrative account. After another retention interval, there is a third stage, in which participants' memories for the original event are tested. In one experiment, adult participants in Stage 1 watched a fast-paced film of a car driving down a country road (<a href="#c22">Loftus, 1975</a>).
In Stage 2, some participants were asked a misleading question incorrectly suggesting the existence of a barn: “How fast was the white sports car going when it passed the barn while traveling along the country road?” Other participants were asked an unbiased form of the same question that made no mention of the barn: “How fast was the white sports car going while traveling along the country road?” In Stage 3, participants were asked whether they had seen a barn in the film. Participants receiving misleading information were significantly more likely to report having seen a barn than were those who received only unbiased information.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The same basic paradigm has been used in many studies to assess the suggestibility of child witnesses (e.g., <a href="#c10">Cohen &amp; Harnick, 1980</a>; <a href="#c25">Loftus &amp; Davies, 1984</a>; <a href="#c28">Marin et al., 1979</a>; <a href="#c30">Ornstein, Gordon, &amp; Larus, 1992</a>).
These studies have generally found that child witnesses, like adults, are significantly less accurate when exposed to misleading information than when exposed to unbiased information. Because both children and adults are susceptible to misleading information, an important question has been whether children are especially susceptible. If they are, the probative value of their testimony for the jury may be outweighed by the prejudicial value for the defendant's case, prompting judges to rule the testimony inadmissible at trial.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Most studies that have made developmental comparisons have found that young children, especially preschool-age children, are more influenced by misleading information than are older children or adults. For example, <a href="#c7">Ceci, Ross, and Toglia (1987)</a>
told 3- to 12-year-olds a story and then asked them misleading or unbiased questions about it. They found that the 3-year-olds were more likely to report the postevent suggestion on a later memory test than were the older children. <a href="#c10">Cohen and Harnick (1980)</a>
showed a film of a theft to 9-year-olds, 12-year-olds, and adults. Participants were asked both misleading and unbiased questions. The 9-year-olds were more likely to yield to the suggestions than were the older children or the adults. In a recent review of the child witness literature, <a href="#c6">Ceci and Bruck (1993b)</a>
made a strong case for the position that young children are more susceptible than older children or adults to suggestive questioning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The effects of misleading postevent information have typically been discussed in terms of the long-term memorial consequences of the interpolated information. For instance, there has been considerable debate over whether misleading information alters the existing representation of the original event (e.g., <a href="#c24">Loftus, 1979</a>),
renders original information inaccessible (e.g., <a href="#c8">Christiaansen &amp; Ochalek, 1983</a>),
or does neither of these things (e.g., <a href="#c29">McCloskey &amp; Zaragoza, 1985</a>).
More recently, researchers have suggested that witness errors may reflect an inability to distinguish between originally presented and postevent information as the source of their memory (e.g., <a href="#c21">Lindsay, 1994</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Social factors also play a role in the interaction between questioner and witness. Considerable research in social psychology has indicated that the credibility of a communicator influences the persuasiveness of a message (cf. <a href="#c18">Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951</a>).
Likewise, in the eyewitness context, the credibility of the source of misleading information influences its impact on witnesses' reports. For example, <a href="#c33">Smith and Ellsworth (1987)</a>
had trained confederates ask misleading or unbiased questions of participants who had seen a videotaped bank robbery. The participants were told that this questioner either had seen the video several times (credible source) or had never seen the video (noncredible source). Participants were misled only when the source of the misinformation was credible. <a href="#c12">Dodd and Bradshaw (1980)</a>
had participants read a postevent narrative that they were told had been prepared by an innocent bystander (credible source) or by a participant in the accident (noncredible source). Participants were less likely to be misled by the accident participant than by the innocent bystander, presumably because they realized that the accident participant might be biased.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research investigating the impact of social factors on witness credibility has focused primarily on adult witnesses. It is not clear to what extent children are sensitive to social cues regarding source credibility. Most studies comparing the suggestibility of children and adults have involved an adult source presenting misleading information to both child and adult witnesses (cf. <a href="#c10">Cohen &amp; Harnick, 1980</a>).
It is reasonable to assume that the perceived credibility of an adult source to a child is far greater than the perceived credibility of an adult source to another adult. Thus, most studies have confounded age of witness with source credibility. There are, however, a few studies that have shed some light on this issue. For example, <a href="#c35">Warren, Hulse-Trotter, and Tubbs (1991)</a>
had 7-year-olds, 12-year-olds, and adults read a story and answer several misleading questions about it. Before answering the questions, some participants received a warning that some of the questions might be tricky. The warned children were significantly less suggestible, indicating that they were sensitive to at least one kind of credibility cue.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c7">Ceci et al. (1987)</a>
presented misleading or unbiased information by using an adult interviewer or a specially trained 7-year-old interviewer. They found that preschool children were misled by both sources but to a greater degree by the adult interviewer. Thus, even young children were sensitive to differences in questioner credibility derived from the age of the source. In their experiment, both sources were probably perceived by the participants as being credible; to a 3-year-old, a 7-year-old probably holds a credibility advantage. Thus, it is not clear from these results whether preschool children are able to discount misinformation presented by a noncredible source or whether they are sensitive to social cues to credibility that are not age related.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our goal was to determine whether young children are capable of distinguishing credible and noncredible information sources. In this experiment, preschool children listened to a short story, which was patterned after the story used by <a href="#c7">Ceci et al. (1987)</a>.
After a short retention interval, the children watched a videotaped interview of another person who had heard the story. The interview contained either misleading or unbiased information. For some children, the source of this information was credible—an adult. For other children, the source was not credible. Two types of noncredible sources were used. One source was a 3-year-old child who knew no more about the story than the participant did. This source was about the same age as the participant and therefore had no age-related credibility advantage. We included a second noncredible source to determine whether the credibility of adults could be undermined. This source was discredited for our preschool participants by being described as a “silly” adult.</p><a id="apl-80-5-621-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_19" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="apl-80-5-621-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One hundred and twenty children (56 girls and 64 boys), ranging in age from 3 years to 5 years, 9 months (<em>M</em>

In Stage 1, a female experimenter read the children a short, enjoyable story about a girl named Lauren. In the story, Lauren got a stomachache from eating her eggs too fast. The story was accompanied by several illustrations including two illustrations on which the children were later tested: one showing Lauren eating eggs and one showing Lauren with a stomachache. This critical information was presented only in the illustrations and was not mentioned in the story itself. The story took approximately 3 min to read to the children. After the story, the children watched a videotape of children's songs for a 10-min filler period.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Stage 2, participants saw a videotaped interview of another person, Anthony, who had also heard the story about Lauren. Depending on the condition, the experimenter described this person as follows: 
<blockquote><i>Adult (high credibility):</i>
OK, now I'm going to show you a man who was in here earlier today. This man is 24 years old. And he heard the story about Lauren, just like you did. Do you want to see the man who heard the story about Lauren, just like you did?</blockquote><blockquote><i>Silly adult (low credibility):</i>
OK, now I'm going to show you a silly man who was in here earlier today. This man is 24 years old, and he heard the story about Lauren, just like you did. Do you want to see the silly man who heard the story about Lauren, just like you did?</blockquote><blockquote><i>Child (low credibility):</i>
OK, now I'm going to show you a boy who was in here earlier today. This boy is only 3 years old, and he heard the story about Lauren, just like you did. Do you want to see the boy who heard the story about Lauren, just like you did?</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The experimenter showed the children either the misleading or the unbiased version of the interview with Anthony. In the misleading version, Anthony provided incorrect information about what Lauren ate for breakfast and the type of illness she suffered. The interview included the following interchange. The misinformation that was added to the misleading version appears in brackets. 
<blockquote><i>Experimenter:</i>
So Anthony, did you like the story about Lauren?</blockquote><blockquote><i>Anthony:</i>
Yeah.</blockquote><blockquote><i>Experimenter:</i>
I kind of forget what happens. Did Lauren end up eating her breakfast?</blockquote><blockquote><i>Anthony:</i>
Yeah.</blockquote><blockquote>[<i>Experimenter:</i>

And did she get sick?</blockquote><blockquote><i>Anthony:</i>

She got a headache.]</blockquote><blockquote><i>Experimenter:</i>
Oh, OK.</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">After the children watched the videotape, the experimenter played games with them for 10 min. After this retention interval, the participants' memories for what Lauren ate and what kind of illness she suffered were tested. The test was presented to the children as a game. For each item, the children completed a two-alternative forced-choice test in which they were asked to choose between the original picture in the story and an alternative picture containing the suggested detail. Ordering of the alternatives was counterbalanced.</p><a id="apl-80-5-621-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_31" title="Results">Results</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We predicted that preschoolers' accuracy would be significantly poorer when they heard misleading rather than unbiased information, but only when the source of the misleading information was a credible adult.

(1991)</a>
and by <a href="#c7">Ceci et al. (1987)</a>
in important ways. The children in Warren et al.'s study were considerably older than the children in the present study. The present research demonstrated that even preschool-age children are capable of resisting suggestions made by discredited adults. This result is important because research on story understanding has suggested that young children often treat all adults as equally credible. <a href="#c1">Ackerman (1983)</a>
asked first graders, third graders, and adults to resolve inconsistencies in statements made by a child, an authoritative adult, or a nonauthoritative adult. For instance, children were presented with a story in which a doctor (authoritative source) or a school bus driver (nonauthoritative source) called a child's mother and told her that the child's temperature had been taken at school and was normal. Later either the child or the child's teacher contradicted that information and said that the child's temperature was high. Children were asked to determine which person in the story was correct. Unlike the older participants, first graders failed to consider credibility differences between adults in making their judgments and based their judgments only on the source's age. One might predict that on the basis of these results, preschool-age witnesses will consider all adults to be equally credible. The present results provide convincing evidence that this is not the case. Even preschool-age children in our study were able to distinguish between credible and noncredible adults. It may be that young children lack the world knowledge needed to make use of the specific types of credibility cues provided by Ackerman (e.g., occupation). Our results show that when credibility cues were made clear enough, even very young children could make use of them to avoid being influenced by suggestions made by noncredible adult sources.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research also extends <a href="#c7">Ceci et al.'s (1987)</a>
findings in two important ways. First, in Ceci et al.'s study, some children were presented with postevent information from a 7-year-old source. Although this source probably seemed less credible to the preschool-age children in the study than did the adult source, it is still reasonable to assume that the source retained some age-related credibility advantage. In the present study, we equated the age of the source and the witness. Like Ceci et al., we found that preschool-age children were less likely to be influenced by postevent suggestions presented by a child than those presented by an adult. Furthermore, we found that when the source was another preschool-age child, our witnesses were not influenced by the postevent suggestions. Thus, when age of witness and age of source were equated, the child witness rejected the misleading information that was presented. This indicates that even young children are able to distinguish credible from noncredible sources on the basis of the source's age. Second, our results extend the work of Ceci et al. by exploring children's abilities to disregard misinformation presented by discredited adults. Even preschoolers were sophisticated enough judges of credibility to distinguish credible from noncredible adult sources.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although our results show that children were influenced by source credibility cues, it is not yet clear how the children conceptualized those cues. In the persuasion literature, an important distinction is made between manipulations that affect the perceived trustworthiness of a source (cf. <a href="#c13">Eagly, Wood, &amp; Chaiken, 1978</a>)
and those that affect the perceived knowledgeability of a source (<a href="#c27">Maddux &amp; Rogers, 1980</a>).
Similar distinctions can be drawn in the adult suggestibility literature. In <a href="#c12">Dodd and Bradshaw's (1980)</a>
study, which we mentioned in the introduction, the credibility of the source was manipulated by providing the discredited source with a motive for being untruthful. Thus, Dodd and Bradshaw manipulated the perceived trustworthiness of their source. In <a href="#c33">Smith and Ellsworth's (1987)</a>
research, the credibility of the source was manipulated by varying how much the source knew about the film. Thus, Smith and Ellsworth manipulated the perceived knowledgeability of the source. We do not know whether children make a distinction between source trustworthiness and source knowledgeability and, if so, whether source age and the label <em>silly</em>
influence perceived trustworthiness or knowledgeability. Future research should address these issues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Social psychological approaches to suggestibility have mostly limited themselves to asking questions about how source credibility manipulations interact with misleading questioning. Other source variables identified in the persuasion literature, such as the perceived power of the source (<a href="#c36">Wheeless, Barraclough, &amp; Stewert, 1983</a>),
may also be relevant to how both adults and children respond to misleading information. Children are often interviewed about an event by a person whom they are likely to perceive as being powerful and who can reward or punish them either explicitly or implicitly (<a href="#c5">Ceci &amp; Bruck, 1993a</a>).
For instance, <a href="#c26">Loftus and Ketchum (1991)</a>
described a case in which a 5-year-old girl was rewarded with cookies when she made allegations and was sent to her room when she denied anything happened. Children are invariably going to be in a position of unequal power with their interviewer, so it is also important to understand how source power is likely to interact with children's suggestibility. Our results indicate that power differences between an interviewer and a child witness were not controlling because the children were not influenced by the discredited adult, but this power differential may influence children's susceptibility to misleading information in practice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another question for future research concerns the processing mechanisms through which credibility cues operate. As <a href="#c6">Ceci and Bruck (1993b)</a>
pointed out, it might be a mistake to ask whether age-related differences reflect cognitive or social factors, as if cognitive and social variables were unrelated. Rather, it is likely that social factors operate by producing information-processing changes. Elsewhere, we proposed that social persuasion variables can operate through at least two mechanisms (<a href="#c19">Lampinen &amp; Smith, 1994</a>).
First, a variable can alter the probability that a discrepant piece of information is detected. <a href="#c34">Tousignant, Hall, and Loftus (1986)</a>
found that when a witness noticed that postevent information was discrepant, the witness was less likely to be influenced by it. Thus, source credibility could influence witness accuracy by altering the probability that discrepant information will be detected; participants may be more vigilant in their scrutiny of incoming information when the source is not credible. Second, a social persuasion variable could alter how discrepancies are resolved once they are detected. When a witness notices a mismatch between his or her own memory for the event and the source's account of the event, variables such as perceived source credibility may influence how that mismatch is resolved. A witness who is questioned by a credible source may decide that the source's version of the event is more accurate. In that case, the participant would still be misled, even though he or she detected the discrepancy. In the context of children's testimony, an important theoretical question is whether children are more likely to notice discrepancies when the source is low in credibility because they do not trust the source of the information (a discrepancy detection account), or whether children notice discrepancies when they occur but reject their own account of the event when the source is credible (a discrepancy resolution account).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Adopting a social persuasion account of the suggestibility of child witnesses also has important practical implications. This perspective suggests that age-related differences in suggestibility may be a function of differences in how the social situation is perceived. If this is correct, then efforts should be made to develop methods of altering the social situation to decrease the forces that lead to suggestibility. Being able to do that requires developing a better understanding of the types of credibility cues that children understand and the mechanisms through which they operate.</p><a id="apl-80-5-621-ID0E0EB0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_47" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Ackerman, B.
