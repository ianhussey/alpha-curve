surprise to readers that corporal punishment of children is a controversial issue
throughout the United States, including within academia, in political arenas, and
among the public at large. The academic debate is largely divided into those who
argue that corporal punishment in some circumstances is effective and sometimes
necessary to discipline children (<a href="#c15">Baumrind,
1996</a>; <a href="#c132">Larzelere,
1993</a>) and those who assert that there is very little benefit
and rather a substantial risk of harm from using corporal punishment on children
(<a href="#c85">Gershoff, 2002</a>;
<a href="#c141">Lytton, 1997</a>;
<a href="#c144">McCord, 1997</a>;
<a href="#c196">Straus, 2001</a>).
The debate also continues among the public, with popular press newspapers and
magazines continuing to publish articles each year regarding the debate about pros
and cons of using corporal punishment with children. In 2006 alone, articles
appeared in <em>American Baby</em> (<a href="#c138">Lorenzi, 2006</a>), <em>Men's Health</em>
(<a href="#c55">“Corporal
Punishment,” 2006</a>), <em>The New York
Times</em> (<a href="#c139">Lyman,
2006</a>), <em>Parenting</em> (<a href="#c156">O'Callaghan, 2006</a>),
<em>Time</em> (<a href="#c167">Paul,
2006</a>), and <em>USA Today</em> (<a href="#c121">Jones, 2006</a>), among many other
similar publications.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What may come as
more of a surprise to Americans is that discussions of corporal punishment of
children outside the United States have moved beyond academic (in both senses of the
word) debate. Over the past decades, authoritative bodies, charged with interpreting
treaties, have deemed the practice to be a violation of international human rights
law and have urged nations to institute domestic bans on it (United Nations:
<a href="#c52">Committee on the Rights of the Child,
2006</a>; <a href="#c57">Council of
Europe, Parliamentary Assembly, 2005</a>; Council of Europe,
Commissioner for Human Rights: <a href="#c103">Hammarberg, 2006</a>; United Nations Study on Violence Against
Children: <a href="#c170">Pinheiro,
2006</a>). In 2007 alone, Chile, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Portugal, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela adopted legal bans of all corporal
punishment of children, be it by parents, teachers, or other caregivers, bringing
the number of countries with total bans to 23 (<a href="#c91">Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children [Global
Initiative], 2007b</a>). An additional 91 of the world's 231
countries and principalities have banned corporal punishment of children by teachers
or school administrators (<a href="#c90">Global
Initiative, 2007a</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For the purposes of
this article, we define corporal punishment as the use of physical force, no matter
how light, with the intention of causing the child to experience bodily pain so as
to correct or punish the child's behavior (<a href="#c26">Bitensky, 2006</a>; <a href="#c52">Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2006</a>;
<a href="#c196">Straus, 2001</a>).
Such physical force typically includes hitting children either with a hand or with
an object. In the United States, corporal punishment is known by a variety of
euphemisms, including spank, smack, slap, pop, beat, paddle, punch, whup/whip, and
hit (<a href="#c61">Davis, 1996</a>;
<a href="#c149">Mosby, Rawls, Meehan, Mays, &amp;
Pettinari, 1999</a>). Corporal punishment is synonymous with
physical punishment; we use the former as it is the term universally used by the
international research and human rights communities, as well as by school systems in
the United States.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Corporal punishment
remains a common child rearing practice in the United States. In a nationally
representative survey of almost 1,000 parents of 1- and 2-year-olds, 63% reported
using physical punishment (<a href="#c174">Regalado,
Sareen, Inkelas, Wissow, &amp; Halfon, 2004</a>). A smaller
survey of parents of 1- and 2-year-olds found a very similar rate of corporal
punishment, at 65% (<a href="#c189">Socolar, Savage,
&amp; Evans, 2007</a>). We analyzed data from a nationally
representative longitudinal study of over 21,000 children (the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999; <a href="#c225">West, Denton, &amp; Reaney,
2000</a>) and found that by the time these children reached the
fifth grade in 2003, 80% had been corporally punished by their parents. Similarly,
most of the adolescents in a recent study reported having been slapped or spanked
(85%), and half reported having been hit with a belt or similar object (51%;
<a href="#c23">Bender et al.,
2007</a>). Thus, despite the common belief that most parents do not
spank anymore (and that child behavior has deteriorated as a result), in reality, a
majority of parents of young children physically punish them, and most children have
been physically punished by the time they reach adolescence. Although less common
than in homes, corporal punishment continues to be used in schools as well; in the
2004–2005 school year, corporal punishment was administered to a total of
272,028 school children across the nation (<a href="#c158">Office for Civil Rights, 2007</a>). The fact that the
prevalence of corporal punishment remains high in the United States at a time when
countries around the world are taking measures against it indicates a need to assess
the effects of corporal punishment on American children as well as to evaluate its
status in light of international human rights law.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this article, we

abuse. Second, we describe the growing consensus within the international community

research over the course of the past hundred years has examined the effectiveness of
corporal punishment as a means of correcting child misbehavior as well as its
potential unintended negative side effects for children. It is a peculiar hallmark
of the debate surrounding corporal punishment that the preponderance of literature
examining its impacts has not looked at whether it is successful in achieving the
goals parents have when using it, namely, promoting children's obedience and
reducing problematic behaviors. Rather, most research has examined whether corporal
punishment might have unintended negative effects, such as increasing children's
levels of aggression. However, it is important to first examine the evidence of its
effectiveness, or the lack thereof, in achieving parents' short- or long-term goals
in using corporal punishment. There is, after all, no reason to resort to corporal
punishment in the first place if it does not work.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the sections

the effects of corporal punishment (<a href="#c85">Gershoff, 2002</a>). <a href="#c85">Gershoff (2002)</a> reviewed 88 studies that had been conducted
over a period of 62 years and calculated average effect sizes for the associations
of corporal punishment with 11 child outcomes. We complement the Gershoff findings
with summaries of the findings from more recently published research.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EDFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Does Corporal Punishment Promote Child Obedience and Reduce Child Problem
Behavior?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Parents use
corporal punishment primarily to reduce undesirable child behavior in the
present and to increase desirable child behavior in the future. It is useful to
consider the success with which corporal punishment achieves these two goals
separately, given that one is an immediate, short-term goal while the second is
a future, long-term goal. The empirical findings on the short-term effectiveness
of corporal punishment in achieving child compliance are mixed. Although the
<a href="#c85">Gershoff (2002)</a>
meta-analysis of five studies examining children's immediate compliance with a
parent's use of corporal punishment found a positive effect on average, the
findings were highly inconsistent. The meta-analysis was primarily driven by the
large effect size reported by one study (<em>d</em> = 3.39;
<a href="#c18">Bean &amp; Roberts,
1981</a>) but also included two other studies by the same
investigator, one that basically found no relationship (<em>d</em> =
−0.01; <a href="#c62">Day &amp; Roberts,
1983</a>) and one that found a negative relationship
(<em>d</em> = −0.25; <a href="#c176">Roberts &amp; Powers, 1990</a>). It is also
worth noting that these authors have clearly stated that corporal punishment is
not the only way to control child behavior and that parents with a history of
abusing their children should be counseled not to spank (<a href="#c62">Day &amp; Roberts, 1983</a>;
<a href="#c176">Roberts &amp; Powers,
1990</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although
parents clearly hope to promote children's future compliance with whichever
discipline technique they choose, exactly how corporal punishment should foster
children's long-term compliance or moral internalization is unclear from
psychological theory and research. At its most basic, the association of a
negative stimulus with a behavior should make the behavior less likely in the
future. Yet this type of obedience is not thought of as internalized because it
likely only occurs if the child perceives the threat of punishment to be high
(e.g., the parent is nearby and likely to administer punishment). The primary
goal of any socialization should be to promote children's internalization of the
reasons for behaving appropriately rather than to behave solely to avoid
punishment (<a href="#c108">Hoffman,
1983</a>; <a href="#c135">Lepper,
1983</a>). The research to date indicates that physical
punishment does not promote long-term, internalized compliance. In contrast to
the findings on immediate compliance, the findings regarding corporal punishment
as a predictor of moral internalization are more consistent, with 85% of the
studies included in the <a href="#c85">Gershoff
(2002)</a> meta-analysis reporting corporal punishment to be
associated with less moral internalization and long-term compliance. Similarly,
the more children receive physical punishment, the less likely they are to
express empathy for others (<a href="#c137">Lopez,
Bonenberger, &amp; Schneider, 2001</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Parents report
that one of the main instances in which they use corporal punishment is when
their children have behaved aggressively, such as hitting a younger sibling, or
antisocially, such as stealing money from parents (<a href="#c36">Catron &amp; Masters, 1993</a>;
<a href="#c109">Holden, Coleman, &amp;
Schmidt, 1995</a>; <a href="#c217">Zahn-Waxler &amp; Chapman, 1982</a>). Yet
there are many reasons to suspect that physical punishment may increase, rather
than decrease, children's aggression and antisocial behavior, including that it
models the use of force to achieve desired ends (<a href="#c14">Bandura &amp; Walters, 1959</a>;
<a href="#c76">Eron, Walder, &amp; Lefkowitz,
1971</a>) and increases the likelihood that children will
make hostile attributions that, in turn, increase the likelihood that they will
behave inappropriately in social interactions (<a href="#c64">Dodge, 1986</a>; <a href="#c212">Weiss, Dodge, Bates, &amp; Pettit, 1992</a>).
Thus, it is particularly important to determine whether corporal punishment is
effective in achieving one of parents' main goals in using it, namely, to reduce
children's aggressive and antisocial behaviors. In <a href="#c85">Gershoff's (2002)</a> meta-analysis of
27 studies, every one of the studies found corporal punishment was associated
with more, not less, child aggression. Of the 13 studies included in a
meta-analysis of the association of corporal punishment to child antisocial
behavior, 12 found more corporal punishment was associated with more antisocial
behavior. In both cases, the size of the association was moderate (aggression:
<em>d</em> = 0.36; antisocial behavior: <em>d</em> = 0.42;
<a href="#c85">Gershoff,
2002</a>). Similarly, in recent studies of children around the
globe, corporal punishment has been associated linearly with more physical
aggression (Canada: <a href="#c164">Pagani et al.,
2004</a>; China: <a href="#c155">Nelson, Hart, Yang, Olsen, &amp; Jin, 2006</a>; China,
India, Italy, Kenya, Philippines, and Thailand: <a href="#c86">Gershoff et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c131">Lansford et al., 2005</a>;
Singapore: <a href="#c185">Sim &amp; Ong,
2005</a>), verbal aggression (Canada: <a href="#c164">Pagani et al., 2004</a>), physical
fighting and bullying (United States: <a href="#c162">Ohene, Ireland, McNeely, &amp; Borowsky, 2006</a>),
antisocial behavior (United States: <a href="#c95">Grogan-Kaylor, 2004</a>, <a href="#c96">2005</a>), and behavior problems generally
(Norway: <a href="#c120">Javo, Rønning,

<a href="#c145">McLoyd &amp; Smith,
2002</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The main
conclusion to be drawn from these highly consistent results across the empirical
literature is that if parents' goals are to increase children's moral
internalization and to decrease their aggressive and antisocial behavior, there
is little evidence that corporal punishment is effective in achieving these
goals.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0ECFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">How Do We Know That Parental Corporal Punishment Causes Increased Child
Defiance and Problem Behavior?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The research
summarized above suggests that, when examined through the lens of a parent's
goals, corporal punishment is not successful in achieving increases in long-term
compliance and decreases in defiant and aggressive behavior. Because experiments
assigning children to parents who spank or not or assigning parents to spank or
no-spank conditions are both unfeasible and unethical, much of the research on
parental corporal punishment is correlational (i.e., measuring relations among
variables within one point in time) and thus precludes conclusions about
direction of effect (<a href="#c16">Baumrind,
Larzelere, &amp; Cowan, 2002</a>; <a href="#c85">Gershoff, 2002</a>). Although there
are many examples of rigorous, prospective, longitudinal studies of the effects
of corporal punishment on children's later development that provide some ability
to draw causal conclusions (discussed below), the field's overall reliance on
correlational studies of corporal punishment has left open the possibility that
the causal pathway may not be entirely (or at all, by some accounts) from parent
to child as is typically assumed. Two primary alternative hypotheses have been
offered to explain the association of parent corporal punishment with higher
levels of defiance and problem behavior in children. The first such hypothesis
is that this association is a child effect (<a href="#c21">Bell, 1968</a>), or, in other words, it is the
result of difficult children eliciting corporal punishment from their parents
rather than of parents' use of corporal punishment causing children to be
aggressive (<a href="#c16">Baumrind et al.,
2002</a>; <a href="#c24">Benjet
&amp; Kazdin, 2003</a>; <a href="#c133">Larzelere, Kuhn, &amp; Johnson, 2004</a>).
The other alternative hypothesis is that a third variable altogether, namely,
shared genetics, predicts both parental corporal punishment and child problem
behavior, and thus, the found associations between them are spurious
(<a href="#c175">Reiss,
1995</a>). We consider each hypothesis in turn,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>The child effect alternative hypothesis</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The crux of
this argument is that children high in problem behavior are more likely to
frustrate their parents, who in turn will be more likely to use harsh
discipline, in which case the direction of effect would be from child to
parent rather than from parent to child (<a href="#c16">Baumrind et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#c24">Benjet &amp; Kazdin, 2003</a>;
<a href="#c133">Larzelere et al.,
2004</a>). Some support for the reasoning behind this
alternative hypothesis comes from experiments in which both familiar and
unfamiliar adults behaved more harshly with children who were difficult
(<a href="#c9">Anderson, Lytton, &amp;
Romney, 1986</a>). Furthermore, parents use punishments
generally and corporal punishment in particular more for misbehaviors
involving aggression (<a href="#c99">Grusec
&amp; Kuczynski, 1980</a>; <a href="#c109">Holden et al., 1995</a>;
<a href="#c190">Socolar &amp; Stein,
1995</a>), so it is reasonable to expect that children who
engage in frequent aggressive acts would be corporally punished by their
parents more than would less aggressive children.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One way to
address this question is by including initial levels of child problem
behavior as a predictor along with parent's use of corporal punishment to
predict later child problem behavior. By controlling for initial levels of
child problem behavior, such analyses are able to look at the unique
prediction of corporal punishment as if all children had average levels of
problem behavior. Studies reporting such analyses continue to find that
corporal punishment predicts later problem behavior even after initial
levels of such behaviors and race, gender, and family socioeconomic status
have been controlled (e.g., <a href="#c95">Grogan-Kaylor, 2004</a>, <a href="#c96">2005</a>; <a href="#c100">Gunnoe &amp; Mariner, 1997</a>;
<a href="#c186">Singer, Singer, &amp;
Rapaczynski, 1984</a>; <a href="#c212">Weiss et al., 1992</a>). These studies thus
do not support the child effect hypothesis and rather lend support to the
parent-to-child direction of effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Yet such
studies do not directly test whether child behavior problems predict parent
corporal punishment in the future, which would be needed to entirely rule
out the possibility that a child-to-parent direction of effect is at work. A
second line of research addresses this possibility by comparing parent- with
child-effect pathways using cross-lagged structural equation models.
Cross-lagged models simultaneously estimate predictive paths from parental
corporal punishment to child behavior and vice versa. Two such studies do
confirm the presence of a child effect on the frequency with which parents
use harsh (including corporal) punishment (<a href="#c45">Cohen &amp; Brook, 1995</a>;
<a href="#c124">Kandel &amp; Wu,
1995</a>), while a third did not find a child effect on
harsh punishment (<a href="#c34">Campbell, Pierce,
Moore, Marakovitz, &amp; Newby, 1996</a>). In
contrast, all three of these studies also found strong parent effects on
later child behavior problems, and by comparing the percent of variance
explained, <a href="#c124">Kandel and Wu
(1995)</a> concluded that initial child behavior problems
and initial parent harsh punishment did a better job predicting subsequent
child behavior problems in their cross-lagged model than they did subsequent
harsh punishment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A very
strong test of parent versus child effects comes from a recent evaluation of
a parent-training program that included reduction of corporal punishment as
a goal (<a href="#c19">Beauchaine,
Webster-Stratton, &amp; Reid, 2005</a>). The study
examined change in parents' use of corporal punishment as a mediator of the
impact of parent training on children's externalizing problem behaviors.
Crucially for the alternative hypothesis at hand, the model explicitly
tested whether the parent training reduced child externalizing behavior
problems by reducing parents' use of corporal punishment (a parent effect)
after controlling for child effects at baseline and across time. Results
from research with over 500 families revealed that significant reductions in
children's externalizing behavior problems were a direct result of decreases
in parents' reliance on corporal punishment as a result of program
participation (<a href="#c19">Beauchaine et al.,
2005</a>). These analyses present strong support for a
causal link between parents' use of corporal punishment and children's
subsequent behavior problems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>The shared genetics alternative hypothesis</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The second
main alternative hypothesis is that the association between parental
corporal punishment and child aggression or problem behavior is explained by
the fact that both are predicted by the same factor, namely, shared
genetics. Proponents of this hypothesis argue that a shared genetic
predisposition to be aggressive could result in both parents and children
being easily frustrated and aggressive, which is manifest as harsh
discipline by the parent and aggressive and problem behaviors in the child.
The implication is that it is not a parent's use of corporal punishment that
makes his or her child more aggressive but rather that a parent's tendency
to become aggressive when frustrated may be inherited by the child and that
it is this shared aggressive tendency that causes parents to use corporal
punishment and children to act aggressively toward peers (<a href="#c175">Reiss, 1995</a>). Given that
parents' use of corporal punishment has been found to have a nontrivial
heritable component (<a href="#c210">Wade
&amp; Kendler, 2000</a>), it is indeed feasible that
shared genetics may underlie both parent and child behaviors. We summarize
the results of four separate studies that have examined the potential
genetic basis for the association of parental corporal punishment with child
behavior problems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first
of these studies actually started by investigating the flip side of the
argument, by examining whether nonshared genetic contributions explain the
associations of corporal punishment with child behavior problems in the
families of adopted children. Using cross-sectional data from a sample of
adopted children and their adoptive and biological parents,
<a href="#c83">Ge and colleagues
(1996)</a> found that after controlling for genetic risk
(indexed as psychiatric disorder in their biological parents), there were
significant bidirectional effects between mothers' use of harsh and
inconsistent discipline (including corporal punishment) and children's
antisocial behavior; each significantly predicted the other. For fathers,
only a child effect was found, such that the child's antisocial behavior
predicted fathers' use of harsh and inconsistent discipline but not vice
versa. The fact that both parent and child effects were identified in a
sample of parents and children who were not genetically related appears to
undercut the shared genetics explanation. A second study, by
<a href="#c157">O'Connor, Deater-Deckard,
Fulker, Rutter, and Plomin (1998)</a> replicated the Ge
et al. study using longitudinal data. Although O'Connor et al. confirmed
that children at genetic risk did evoke more negative parenting from their
adoptive parents, adoptive parents' use of negative parenting continued to
predict children's problem behaviors even after the genetic risk had been
partialed out. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that although there
is a child genetic effect that evokes corporal punishment from parents,
there is an equally strong effect of corporal punishment on the development
of nongenetically related children's behavior problems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The
contribution of shared genetics has been examined explicitly in two twin
studies. <a href="#c118">Jaffee and colleagues
(2004)</a> confirmed a strong heritable component to the
association between corporal punishment and antisocial behavior (which
contrasted with the absence of a heritable component to child maltreatment);
in other words, some inherited disposition, such as a tendency toward
aggression or a short fuse, makes parents likely to use corporal punishment
and children to act aggressively. In a study of twins and their parenting of
their own children, <a href="#c140">Lynch et al.
(2006)</a> found that when adult twins differed in their
use of harsh physical punishment with their own biological children, the
twin who used more harsh physical punishment had children with more
externalizing, internalizing, and drug and alcohol abuse symptoms. Thus,
when shared genetics are controlled, harsh physical punishment predicts
greater symptomatology in children. Unfortunately, this study did not report
parallel analyses for mild physical punishment alone, but the findings
provide further evidence that shared genetics do not entirely explain the
association of parental corporal punishment with child behavior problems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These
studies indeed have found a genetic basis for the association of corporal
punishment and child behavior problems. However, it is equally important to
note that parental corporal punishment has been found to predict behavior
problems in adopted children (<a href="#c83">Ge et
al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c157">O'Connor et al., 1998</a>); thus, shared
genetics are by no means a necessary condition for corporal punishment to
predict child behavior problems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Additional evidence against both alternative hypotheses</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One added
bit of evidence against both the child effect and the shared genetics
alternative hypotheses is that they go against parents' agency and intention
in using corporal punishment. Both hypotheses assume an affective or
uncontrolled, rather than a cognitive and planned, component to parents' use
of corporal punishment. Parents use corporal punishment, as they do all
discipline, because they see it as an effective means to achieve their
goals, namely, to end current and reduce future child misbehavior. In other
words, parents use corporal punishment for the very reason that they assume
a parent effect will occur, not purely out of a sense of frustration with
child behavior or a reflexive reaction driven by genetic predispositions. If
frequent corporal punishment is the result of parents' impulsive reaction to
difficult child behavior, rather than a long-term strategy for child
behavior change, we would expect such frequent corporal punishment to be an
emotional rather than an instrumental reaction to child behavior. Instead,
research has shown that parents who use corporal punishment frequently are
much more likely than those who use it rarely to say they use corporal
punishment out of a belief in its instrumental effectiveness in achieving
appropriate child behavior (<a href="#c110">Holden, Miller, &amp; Harris, 1999</a>). Thus,
parents themselves report using more corporal punishment with the intention
that it will improve their children's behavior, not out of a short-term
frustration with inappropriate child behavior or a genetically driven
aggressive response to child misbehavior.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Summary</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although
research on parenting will always fall short of the gold standard for
establishing causality in science because children cannot be randomly
assigned to parents in experimental conditions, the sum total of the
research summarized above does lead to some conclusions. It is clearly the
case that children with more behavior problems, either for genetic or for
other reasons, elicit more corporal punishment from their parents. However,
even after these child effects are accounted for, parental corporal
punishment continues to predict levels in and changes in children's behavior
problems.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EBFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Does Corporal Punishment Put Children at Risk for Unintended Negative

(2002)</a> meta-analysis of 12 studies found that the
frequency or severity with which children experienced corporal punishment
was associated with increased mental health problems in children in every
study. Subsequent studies not included in the meta-analysis have confirmed
across multiple countries the association of corporal punishment with
impairments in children's mental health, including anxiety and depression
(Hungary: <a href="#c59">Csorba et al.,

<a href="#c195">Steely &amp; Rohner,

experiencing corporal punishment should be associated with mental health
problems is increased stress. Frequency of corporal punishment has been
found to predict self-reported psychological distress among
10–16-year-olds, even at low rates of corporal punishment
(<a href="#c200">Turner &amp; Finkelhor,
1996</a>). In children as young as 1 year old, toddlers
who experience frequent corporal punishment show elevated levels of the
stress hormone cortisol in reaction to an anxiety-provoking interaction
involving their mothers (<a href="#c31">Bugental,
Martorell, &amp; Barraza, 2003</a>). Such findings
are markedly similar to those from a large body of research that has linked
the experience of physical assault substantiated as abuse with lasting

associated with deteriorated mental health in eight studies included in
<a href="#c85">Gershoff's
(2002)</a> meta-analysis. Subsequent studies continue to
find that mental health problems such as increased depressive symptoms in
adulthood are predicted by levels of corporal punishment experienced as a
child (<a href="#c201">Turner &amp; Muller,
2004</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Eroded parent–child relationship quality</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One of the
main concerns about corporal punishment is that its use will disrupt
parent–child relationships (<a href="#c13">Azrin &amp; Holz, 1966</a>). It works like
this: Children are motivated to avoid painful experiences, and if they see
their parents as sources of pain (as delivered via physical punishment),
they will attempt to avoid their parents (<a href="#c98">Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994</a>;
<a href="#c142">Maccoby &amp; Martin,
1983</a>), which in turn will erode feelings of trust
and closeness between parent and child (<a href="#c13">Azrin &amp; Holz, 1966</a>;
<a href="#c165">Parke,
1977</a>). Such concerns have in fact been borne out in
research findings, with 13 out of 13 studies finding corporal punishment to
be associated with eroded parent–child relationship quality
(<a href="#c85">Gershoff,
2002</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Adult aggression and antisocial behavior</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Children
can carry the lessons they have learned about the acceptability of
aggression as a problem-solving measure and as a method of controlling
others' behavior into their own adulthoods. Children who have experienced
corporal punishment are more likely to report having hit a dating partner
than children who have not been physically punished (<a href="#c197">Straus, 2004</a>). The more men
and women report having been physically punished as a child, the more they
report using verbal and physical aggression and ineffective problem-solving
behaviors with their spouses (<a href="#c35">Cast,
Schweingruber, &amp; Berns, 2006</a>). An increased
likelihood that individuals who were physically punished in childhood will
perpetrate violence as adults on their own family members was found in
<a href="#c85">Gershoff
(2002)</a>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Alternative explanations</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There are
no clear alternative explanations for this set of unintended consequences of
parental corporal punishment. The child effect alternative hypothesis used
to explain the link with child behavior problems makes little sense for the
link with child mental health conditions; it seems unlikely that a child's
symptoms of anxiety or depression would make a parent so frustrated or angry
as to increase the parent's use of physical punishment or any other forms of
discipline. Rather, longitudinal research has found that parents use less,
not more, power assertion with anxious and fearful children
(<a href="#c128">Kochanska, Aksan, &amp;
Joy, 2007</a>). They do so with good reason: Discipline
techniques high in power assertion, including corporal punishment, have been
found to substantially undermine moral internalization among children high
in fearfulness or anxiety (<a href="#c128">Kochanska et al., 2007</a>). Children's levels of
depression and anxiety have also been found to predict less physical
punishment (<a href="#c97">Grogan-Kaylor &amp;
Otis, 2007</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Regarding
the parent–child relationship, it is possible that a parent who
does not have a close, warm, or trusting relationship with his or her child
will be more likely to use corporal punishment out of frustration,
resentment, or ill will. Unfortunately, no studies have examined this
possibility.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A
protracted version of the child effect hypothesis could be developed for the
association between childhood experiences of corporal punishment and
aggression and problem behavior in adulthood. A child effect explanation
would state that children with high levels of behavior problems elicit more
corporal punishment from their parents (as noted above) and that these same
behavior problems persist into adulthood; thus, any association of early
corporal punishment with later behavior problems would in fact be driven by
the child effect. Some evidence to support this alternative hypothesis comes
from a longitudinal study of the development of aggression by
<a href="#c75">Eron, Huesmann, and Zelli
(1991)</a>. Although they found experiences of corporal
punishment at 8 years old to predict aggression at 19 and 30 years of age in
bivariate analyses, the association was no longer statistically significant
once aggression at 8 years old was controlled. Unfortunately, most of the
other studies of corporal punishment and aggression and problem behavior in
adulthood have been retrospective and thus unable to address this
alternative hypothesis as directly as did Eron and colleagues.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EAFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Are Children Who Are Physically Punished More Likely to Be Physically Abused?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A particularly
troubling aspect of corporal punishment and one that underlies much of the
current policy and advocacy surrounding it is its association with physical
abuse. Child abuse researchers have long argued that corporal punishment and
physical abuse are points along a continuum of violence against children
(<a href="#c81">Garbarino,
1977</a>; <a href="#c84">Gelles
&amp; Straus, 1988</a>; <a href="#c219">Zigler &amp; Hall, 1989</a>). The
distinctions between physical punishment and abuse, this argument goes, are
arbitrary, as the same behavior (e.g., hitting children to cause pain) is put in
one group or another solely on the basis of degree of force used or amount of
pain or injury inflicted upon the child. This overlap between corporal
punishment and physical abuse is recognized by the federal agency charged with
preventing child abuse. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office
on Child Abuse and Neglect has defined physical abuse as including injuries that
result “from severe discipline, including injurious spanking, or
corporal punishment that is inappropriate to the child's age or
condition” (<a href="#c93">Goldman, Salus,
Wolcott, &amp; Kennedy, 2003</a>, p. 16). The variations
in state-level legal distinctions between punishment and abuse are described in
more detail below.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The argument
that corporal punishment and physical abuse are intrinsically related is
supported by the fact that most incidents of physical abuse take place within a
punishment context (<a href="#c88">Gil,
1973</a>; <a href="#c122">Kadushin
&amp; Martin, 1981</a>; <a href="#c208">Vasta, 1982</a>). Examinations of substantiated
physical abuse cases reveal that many indeed began as corporal punishment. In
the 2003 Canadian Incidence Study of Child Maltreatment (<a href="#c72">Durrant et al., 2006</a>), 75% of
substantiated cases of physical abuse involved the use of corporal punishment.
Abusive parents in the United States themselves reveal that as many as
two-thirds of their abusive incidents began as attempts to change children's
behavior or to teach them a lesson (<a href="#c54">Coontz &amp; Martin, 1988</a>; <a href="#c88">Gil, 1973</a>; <a href="#c122">Kadushin &amp; Martin,
1981</a>). The fact that parents in treatment for past
substantiated abuse spank their children significantly more often than parents
without history of abuse (<a href="#c213">Whipple
&amp; Richey, 1997</a>) suggests that physical abuse is
more likely among parents who use corporal punishment frequently. The frequency
with which corporal punishment used is in fact a marker of severity and thus of
abuse: Child welfare professionals, whose job it is to identify abusive
behavior, view spanking as abusive if it occurs frequently (more than once a
week) although less so when it is used rarely (1–3 times per year) or
occasionally (less than once a month; <a href="#c214">Whitney, Tajima, Herrenkohl, &amp; Huang, 2006</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c85">Gershoff
(2002)</a> found a very strong (effect size <em>d</em> =
0.69) and consistent (in 10 out of 10 studies examined) relation between
parents' use of corporal punishment and the likelihood that the parent would
physically injure the child or be reported to a child protective services
agency. Having experienced corporal punishment at the hands of their parents
(such as pinching, shaking, or spanking) puts children at 7 times greater risk
of undergoing severe violence (such as punching, kicking, or hitting with an
object; <a href="#c44">Clément, Bouchard,
Jetté, &amp; Laferrière, 2000</a>) and
make them more than 2 times as likely to suffer an injury requiring medical
attention (<a href="#c58">Crandall, Chiu, &amp;
Sheehan, 2006</a>) compared with children who have not
experienced corporal punishment. In their study of twins, <a href="#c118">Jaffee and colleagues (2004)</a>
found that there is a significant genetic component to whether children receive
corporal punishment but not to whether they are physically abused; thus, the
strong co-occurrence of corporal punishment and child maltreatment in their
sample could not be explained by shared genetics but rather by shared family
environments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On the global
stage, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has stated clearly and firmly
that the evidence points to a connection between corporal punishment and
physical abuse. In an analysis of child deaths from maltreatment in the 30
wealthy nations that are members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development, UNICEF called corporal punishment “the most common
form of violence in the industrialized world” (<a href="#c206">UNICEF, 2003</a>, p. 23). It went on
to call resolutely for a global ban on corporal punishment as a way to
drastically decrease fatal violence against children (<a href="#c206">UNICEF, 2003</a>).</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_70" title="International Human Rights Law Regarding Corporal Punishment of Children">International Human Rights Law Regarding Corporal Punishment of Children</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While the effects
and effectiveness of corporal punishment on children continue to be debated in
academia, the rest of the world has moved ahead to accord corporal punishment of
children the status of a human rights violation. The Commissioner for Human Rights
of the Council of Europe condemned corporal punishment in a recent statement,
observing that 
<blockquote>Children
have had to wait until last to be given equal legal protection from
deliberate assaults—a protection the rest of us take for granted.
It is extraordinary that children, whose developmental state and small size
is acknowledged to make them particularly vulnerable to physical and
psychological injury, should be singled out for less protection from
assaults on their fragile bodies, minds and dignity. (Hammarberg, 2006, paras.
4–5)</blockquote> The concern that the practice of legalized corporal punishment does
not afford children the same protection as adults has been echoed by the independent
expert who headed the U.N. Study on Violence Against Children (<a href="#c170">Pinheiro, 2006</a>). The final report
from the study urged all countries to prohibit “all forms of violence
against children, in all settings, including all corporal punishment”
(<a href="#c170">Pinheiro, 2006</a>,
para. 98).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The view of the
international lawmaking community overwhelmingly is that corporal punishment of
children violates international human rights law (<a href="#c26">Bitensky, 2006</a>). This principle of law implicitly
stems from at least seven multilateral human rights treaties: the <a href="#c207">United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
([Children's Convention] 1989</a>); the <a href="#c116">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
([ICCPR] 1966)</a>; the <a href="#c224">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
([ICESCR] 1966)</a>; the <a href="#c53">Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment ([Torture Convention] 1984</a>); the
<a href="#c220">American Convention on Human Rights
([American Convention] 1969)</a>; and the two European Social
Charters (<a href="#c222">European Social Charter,

Charter [Revised], 1996</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of the above
treaties, the United States has ratified and therefore is a party to the
<a href="#c116">ICCPR (1966)</a> and
the <a href="#c53">Torture Convention
(1984)</a>, making them “the supreme Law of the
Land” under the U.S. Constitution (art. VI, para. 2). Counterintuitive
though it may appear, such an exalted characterization does not avail children much
in terms of vesting them with a mandatory right to protection against corporal
punishment. Caveats and complications abound. The federal government has made
reservations to some of the pertinent provisions of these conventions so as to
effectively inhibit the provisions' present application to corporal punishment of
children in the United States (U.S. Reservation (3) to art. 7 of the ICCPR:
<a href="#c160">Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights [OHCHR] 2007b</a>; U.S.
Reservation I(1) to art. 16 of the Torture Convention: <a href="#c159">OHCHR, 2007a</a>). Legal technicalities
concerning non-self-executing treaties also make the conventions, in the absence of
implementing legislation, unenforceable in American courts (U.S. Declaration (1) to
arts. 1–27 of the ICCPR: <a href="#c160">OHCHR,
2007b</a>; U.S. Declaration III(1) to arts. 1–16 of
the Torture Convention: <a href="#c159">OHCHR,
2007a</a>; <a href="#c168">Paust,
2003</a>). Congress has as yet not enacted legislation to implement
ICCPR or Torture Convention provisions germane to the issue of corporal punishment
of children. However, the lack of domestic judicial enforceability does not negate
the legal duty of both the government and the private sector to adhere to both
international conventions, and adherence to the provisions of the conventions is
monitored internationally by United Nations committees. Because these committees
have no power of compulsion, the arrangement is essentially one of an honor system,
in which the government and private actors may avoid compliance without serious
repercussions (<a href="#c116">ICCPR,
1966</a>, arts. 28, 40; <a href="#c143">Mayerfeld, 2007</a>; <a href="#c53">Torture Convention, 1984</a>, arts. 17–20).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the United
States has not ratified the <a href="#c207">Children's

it has signed these three treaties. Mere signature does imply intention to ratify
but, by itself, does not suffice to make the United States a party to these
treaties. Nevertheless, signature does still impose certain legal obligations on the
signatory nation. It is well established that signing a treaty requires a nation
“to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the
treaty… until it shall have made its intention clear not to become a party

relevant point for purposes of this article is that there is extant the unqualified
international law principle forbidding corporal punishment of children. The United
States' current rejection of the principle does not alter its force as law elsewhere
or its didactic potential to influence reform in the United States. Indeed, because
the legal principle is so widely accepted and is an authoritative expression of
world opinion, it is a resource that should at least serve to inform and enrich
consideration of the corporal punishment issue by American policymakers
(<a href="#c25">Bitensky, 1998</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of the seven
treaties listed above, the <a href="#c116">ICCPR
(1966)</a> and the <a href="#c53">Torture
Convention (1984)</a> may have special salience as templates for
American policymakers, given United States party status and the international
understanding of these conventions' terms. The Committee on Human Rights monitors
the ICCPR, and the Committee Against Torture monitors the Torture Convention. Both
of these committees have stated that the interdiction on torture or other cruel,
inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, a provision included in both
treaties, requires a ban on corporal punishment of children in all contexts
(<a href="#c46">Committee Against Torture,
1995</a>, <a href="#c47">1999</a>, <a href="#c48">2007</a>; <a href="#c49">Committee on
Human Rights, 2007</a>). A former U.N. Special Rapporteur on
Torture, Theo van Boven, stated that “any form of corporal punishment of
children is contrary to the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment punishment” (Report of the <a href="#c191">Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 2002</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The
<a href="#c207">Children's Convention
(1989)</a> is particularly relevant to the case of corporal
punishment. The Children's Convention is unique in being the first international
treaty to focus solely on the physical, social, cultural, political, and civil
rights of children (for a detailed discussion of the history and content of the
convention, see <a href="#c136">Limber &amp;
Flekkøy, 1995</a>). The United States was among the
countries that played a crucial role in the drafting of the Children's Convention
over a 10-year period (<a href="#c127">Kilbourne,
1999</a>). The Children's Convention has been ratified by 192
countries around the world. Only two countries have signed but not ratified the
treaty: Somalia and the United States. Whether or not the Children's Convention now
also constitutes customary international law that binds even nonparty countries is
open to debate (<a href="#c26">Bitensky,
2006</a>), but it is abundantly clear that the United States is
quite isolated in not having ratified this treaty.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The
<a href="#c207">Children's Convention
(1989)</a> created the Committee on the Rights of the Child to
monitor states parties' compliance with its terms. The committee recently issued
General Comment No. 8, which forcefully declared that 
<blockquote>There is no
ambiguity: “all forms of physical or mental violence”
does not leave room for any level of legalized violence against children.
Corporal punishment and other cruel or degrading forms of punishment are
forms of violence and the State must take all appropriate legislative,
administrative, social and educational measures to eliminate them.
(CRC/C/GC/8: Committee on the
Rights of the Child, 2006, para. 18)</blockquote> The Committee on the Rights of the Child made article 19(1) of the
Children's Convention the cornerstone of the comment on the basis of that
provision's absolute prohibition of “all forms of physical or mental
violence” (<a href="#c207">Children's
Convention, 1989</a>, p. 8). The committee further relied upon
children's right to protection from “cruel, inhuman, or degrading
punishment or treatment” (<a href="#c207">Children's Convention, 1989</a>, art. 37(a), p. 10) and the
guarantee of “school discipline [that] is administered in a manner
consistent with the child's human dignity” (<a href="#c207">Children's Convention, 1989</a>, art.
28(2), p. 8; <a href="#c52">Committee on the Rights of the
Child, 2006</a>). This is not the first time that the committee
has interpreted the Children's Convention's language to forbid all corporal
punishment of children. In hundreds of its compliance assessments of individual
countries, the committee has repeatedly invoked the above provisions and a host of
others from the Children's Convention (e.g., <a href="#c207">Children's Convention, 1989</a>, arts. 2(1), 3(1),
6(2), 12(1), 24(3), 37(c), and 39) as mandating that states parties must take legal
and educational measures against this disciplinary practice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although none of
these treaty provisions mention corporal punishment explicitly, the committee has
made clear that such punishment denies children their rights under the convention
articles cited above (<a href="#c52">Committee on the
Rights of the Child, 2006</a>). In taking this approach, the
committee is relying upon the accepted rules of treaty interpretation requiring that
a treaty's words be given their “ordinary meaning”
(<a href="#c209">Treaty on Treaties,
1969</a>, art. 31, para. 1). Ordinary meanings are often implicit
meanings, in legal documents and elsewhere. For example, the term
<em>violence</em> has such ordinary implicit meanings (or
operationalizations, in the terminology of social science) as punching or kicking.
American jurists often interpret the U.S. Constitution and statutes so as to find
reasonable, implicit significations in the express language. Similarly, it is proper
to interpret treaties for their ordinary implicit meanings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While this is not
the place to get into the finer points of international law, it bears mentioning
that many legal experts regard interpretations of treaty-monitoring committees
(e.g., their general comments and compliance assessments) to be soft law that is
more like aspirational guidelines than real law (<a href="#c101">Guzman, 2002</a>; <a href="#c187">Slaughter, 2004</a>). However, it is accurate to say
that the legal status of such soft law is in considerable flux among knowledgeable
academicians (<a href="#c65">Drumbl,
2002</a>; <a href="#c102">Guzman,
2005</a>). A respectable number of them deem soft law to still be
law or to have as significant an effect on changing mores and behavior as hard law
(<a href="#c65">Drumbl, 2002</a>;
<a href="#c187">Slaughter, 2004</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One of the key
criticisms leveled at the <a href="#c207">Children's
Convention (1989)</a> by its detractors in the United States is
that it grants children autonomy rights that supersede the responsibilities of
parents to take care of and protect their children (<a href="#c215">Wilkins, Becker, Harris, &amp; Thayer, 2003</a>).
Such an argument misconstrues both the language and spirit of the Children's
Convention (<a href="#c179">Rutkow &amp; Lozman,
2006</a>). In fact, there is language throughout the Children's
Convention specifically recognizing and supporting the role of the family and of
parental guidance in the child's life (e.g., <a href="#c207">Children's Convention, 1989</a>, art. 3(2)). The
Committee on the Rights of the Child has, however, roundly repudiated the idea that
family/parental interests can ever trump the child's right to be safeguarded from
corporal punishment (see <a href="#c50">Committee on the
Rights of the Child, 1995</a>, <a href="#c51">1998</a>). In light of research findings that corporal
punishment undermines the parent–child relationship (<a href="#c85">Gershoff, 2002</a>), the treaty
prohibitions on this form of discipline actually can be viewed as strengthening the
bond between parents and children and, in so doing, increasing the likelihood that
children will be motivated to comply with their parents (<a href="#c142">Maccoby &amp; Martin, 1983</a>).
Children's rights are ensured only when they are complemented by obligations of
caregivers and, indeed, society to provide these rights (<a href="#c17">Baumrind &amp; Thompson,

utility and even necessity of physical punishment as a method of child rearing has
roots in American historical, cultural, and religious traditions going back to at
least the 17th century (<a href="#c79">Forehand &amp;
McKinney, 1993</a>; <a href="#c94">Greven, 1991</a>). Over time, these traditions have frayed
somewhat, such that today laws in the United States permit some forms of corporal
punishment of children and prohibit others. In this sense, these laws are
illustrative of the legal status of corporal punishment of children in most
countries. Corporal punishment by parents is permitted in 49 states by statute or
court decision (<a href="#c60">Davidson,
1997</a>; <a href="#c74">Edwards,
1996</a>). The exception may be Minnesota, where several statutes
taken together indicate that so-called reasonable parental corporal punishment is a
criminal assault (<a href="#c26">Bitensky,
2006</a>). Current U.S. law emphasizes both the rights and interests
of parents as well as the best interests of children, and in some circumstances, the
interests of parents and children do not correspond (<a href="#c82">Garbarino &amp; Kostelny, 1995</a>). This legal
standing of corporal punishment reflects public opinion that children are in essence
the property of their parents and that parents have the right to raise them as they
choose (<a href="#c22">Belsky, 1993</a>;
<a href="#c172">Pollard, 2003</a>).
The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the fundamental right of parents to direct the
upbringing of their children as protected by due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment (<a href="#c148"><em>Meyer v.
Nebraska</em>, 1923</a>). The Supreme Court has not yet
considered whether parents have a fundamental constitutional right to use corporal
punishment with their children (<a href="#c125">Kearney,
1995</a>; <a href="#c171">Pollard,
2002</a>), which means that a constitutional right of this sort
does not presently exist.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Supreme Court
has, however, considered the constitutionality of corporal punishment administered
by public school personnel at the elementary and secondary levels. The high Court
held by a 5-to-4 margin that this punishment, regardless of its severity, cannot
violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments
(<a href="#c115"><em>Ingraham v. Wright</em>,
1977</a>). In that case, two junior high school students were
hit by their school principal on the buttocks and arms with a wooden paddle 2 feet
long, 3 to 4 inches wide, and half an inch thick. The result was that one child
developed a hematoma requiring medical attention and was unable to function normally
for several days, while the other child lost full use of an arm for a week.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Court relied on
four rationales for its holding. First, the Justices invoked <em>stare

apposite judicial precedents; according to the <em>Ingraham</em> majority,
those precedents limit the reach of the Eighth Amendment to protecting convicts in
relation to the formal sentences handed down by judges in criminal cases. Second,
the Justices claimed that the original intent behind the amendment was to limit its
prohibitions to protecting convicts vis-à-vis such sentences. Third, the
Justices averred that students, unlike prisoners, have no need of the amendment in
view of the benign nature of elementary and secondary schools. Fourth, the Justices
contended that there is no national groundswell of opinion against this form of
punishment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Neither before nor

1976</a>; <a href="#c106"><em>Helling v. McKinney</em>, 1993</a>;
<a href="#c199"><em>Trop v. Dulles</em>,
1958</a>). For example, the Court has applied the Eighth Amendment
to prison conditions that are not part of the specific sentence (<a href="#c106"><em>Helling v. McKinney</em>,
1993</a>). Likewise, there is countervailing evidence of original
intent showing that the amendment's cruel and unusual punishments clause was to have
a much broader compass (<a href="#c178">Rumann,
2004</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although schools
and prisons are obviously very different places, the Justices focused on
distinctions between the two that do not exist in reality and result from an
apparently romanticized view of the conditions in which children are educated. The
Court was trying to show, by invoking these alleged distinctions, that whereas
prisons are closed environments in need of Eighth Amendment oversight, schools are
open environments without the same need. For example, the Justices characterized
students as voluntarily attending school, as being able to leave school premises
whenever they please, and as shielded from physical abuse by the presence of
teachers and other students. The problem with this analysis is that children are in
fact required to attend school (both now and in 1977) by state compulsory education
laws and generally need permission to leave the premises during the school day
(e.g., <a href="#c5">Ala. Code, 2007</a>;
<a href="#c20">Behn, 2007</a>;
<a href="#c117">Iowa Code, 2006</a>).
The presence of teachers, the very persons who may be administering paddlings, does
not seem like a good substitute for the amendment's protection. Similarly, other
students, who are relatively powerless in the school setting and probably
intimidated by authority figures wielding paddles, do not appear well suited to a
protective or deterrent role either.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, it is true
that in 1977, less than a handful of states had legislated against corporal
punishment and that professional opinion was divided about its wisdom. In the past
30 years, the situation has changed dramatically. Twenty-eight states and the
District of Columbia now ban corporal punishment of students in the public schools
(e.g., <a href="#c33">Cal. Educ. Code,
2007</a>; <a href="#c146">Md. Code Ann.,
[Educ.] 2007</a>; see <a href="#c26">Bitensky, 2006</a>, for a complete list). Many of the remaining
22 states empower their local school districts to prohibit the practice, and a large
number have opted for prohibition; these include districts in some of the largest
cities in the country, such as Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas;
Memphis, Tennessee; Miami, Florida; and Tucson, Arizona (<a href="#c37">Center for Effective Discipline,
2007a</a>). In addition, many national professional organizations
concerned with children's physical and mental welfare and well-being have called for
bans on corporal punishment in schools, including the American Academy of
Pediatrics, the American Bar Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
American Psychological Association, the National Association of Elementary School
Principals, the National Association of School Psychologists, the National
Association of Social Workers, the National Association for State Boards of
Education, and the National Education Association (<a href="#c38">Center for Effective Discipline, 2007b</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c115"><em>Ingraham v. Wright</em>
(1977)</a> should be overturned (<a href="#c27">Bitensky, 2008</a>). It has become increasingly
anachronistic. Consider that in 1992, the Court ruled that use of excessive physical
force against a prisoner may constitute an Eighth Amendment violation even though
his bodily injuries are minor (<a href="#c112"><em>Hudson v. McMillian</em>, 1992</a>). This put
the Court in the awkward position of upholding the constitutionality of
injury-causing force against children in public schools while striking down the use
of a similar level of force against adults in penal institutions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One final concern
regarding school corporal punishment is the indisputable evidence that it is not
administered equitably. For the past several decades, research has shown that
African American students and boys are much more likely to receive corporal
punishment in school (<a href="#c89">Glackman, McDowell,
Martin, Hyman, &amp; Spino, 1978</a>) regardless of the
severity or chronicity of the misbehavior in which they engaged (<a href="#c184">Shaw &amp; Braden, 1990</a>). These
biases in the administration of school corporal punishment continue to this day. In
the latest data released by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil
Rights, African American children were 2.5 times more likely than White children and
6.5 times more likely than Hispanic children to receive corporal punishment, and
boys were 3.4 times more likely than girls to receive corporal punishment in the
2004–2005 school year (<a href="#c158">Office
for Civil Rights, 2007</a>). This disproportionality in who is
corporally punished is not equally common across states that allow school corporal
punishment and, in fact, is more common in states with low social capital
(<a href="#c163">Owen, 2005</a>). The
evidence that school administrators have singled out certain populations of students
to receive this particular punishment is troubling.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Beyond the growing
number of states that have banned public school corporal punishment since
<em>Ingraham</em>, there has been a momentum toward delegitimatizing
this punishment in other contexts or settings as well. Most states and the District
of Columbia bar foster parents from using this form of discipline, although the laws
applicable to other residential care settings are more of a hodgepodge. Most states
do not tolerate corporal punishment in nonresidential care facilities such as child
care. Well over half of the states prohibit corporal punishment of juvenile
delinquents when detained or jailed by law enforcement. (See <a href="#c26">Bitensky, 2006</a>, pp. 288–290
&amp; notes 188–207, for analysis and supporting citations.)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All states (except,
perhaps, Minnesota) permit parental corporal punishment of children as long as the
degree of force used is reasonable (or reasonable and moderate, reasonable and
necessary, or reasonable and appropriate). Parental corporal punishment that exceeds
the reasonableness standard is generally categorized as physical child abuse, which
can trigger protective child welfare measures and/or criminal prosecution
(<a href="#c26">Bitensky, 2006</a>;
<a href="#c129">LaFave, 2003</a>,
§ 10.3(a), at pp. 116, 136–138). Examples of what states consider
to be allowable corporal punishment versus prohibited physical abuse can be found in
<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. As is clear from the table, what is deemed
reasonable varies from state to state; indeed, it often varies within a state
according to the predilections and acumen of the judges faced with applying the
standard during litigation. Compare, for example, <a href="#c114"><em>In re Miles</em> (Ohio Ct. App. 2002</a>)
(refusing to find child abuse in relation to parent allowing her fiancé to
bite her 9-year-old's face, leaving marks from both his upper and lower teeth, as a
reprimand for the child's having done the same to a sibling) and <a href="#c43"><em>City of Shaker Heights v. Wright</em> (Ohio
Ct. App. 1996</a>) (finding no liability for child endangering,
but only legal corporal punishment instead, where father whipped his 10-year-old
with a belt so as to produce welts on the child's legs, the scarring of which lasted
for 6 months) with <a href="#c113"><em>In re K.
B</em>. (Ohio Ct. App. 2003</a>) (ruling that there was
child abuse where toddler was spanked with such substantial force as to result in
several bruises on her cheek, abdomen, back, and arm) and <a href="#c193"><em>State v. Howard</em> (Ohio Ct. App.
1999</a>) (holding father guilty of domestic violence and child
abuse for striking his 12-year-old son at least twice on the back and head with a
broom handle, thereby causing a 3- to 4-inch reddish mark to appear on the child's
back). This lack of uniformity makes it difficult, if not impossible, for parents
and caregivers to gauge when their behavior might cross the wavering line from the
legal to the illegal (<a href="#c26">Bitensky,
2006</a>).<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/d71d30c1d65f51d07c8783bf31098fed/571cbbed/pdh/law/law-13-4-231-tbl1a.gif" alt="law-13-4-231-tbl1a.gif" title="Language of U.S. State Laws Specifying What Constitutes Allowable Corporal Punishment&#xA;and What Constitutes Prohibited Corporal Punishment Under Legal Definitions of Physical&#xA;Abuse" /><em>Language of U.S. State Laws Specifying What Constitutes Allowable Corporal Punishment

doubt a growing momentum among countries to enact legal bans on all forms of
corporal punishment, be it delivered by parents, teachers,
administrators—anyone. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe
recently adopted Recommendation 1666, in which it stated, “The Assembly
considers any corporal punishment of children is in breach of their fundamental
right to human dignity and physical integrity… . The social and legal
acceptance of corporal punishment of children must be ended”
(<a href="#c57">Council of Europe, Parliamentary
Assembly, 2005</a>, para. 5). The Parliamentary Assembly went on
to call for a coordinated campaign against corporal punishment in all member
countries (of which there are 45) and to make Europe “a corporal
punishment-free zone for children” (<a href="#c57">Council of Europe, Parliamentary Assembly, 2005</a>,
para. 7).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To date, 23
countries have instituted universal bans on corporal punishment of children: Sweden
(in 1979), Finland (in 1983), Norway (in 1987), Austria (in 1989), Croatia (in
1994), Cyprus (in 1994), Denmark (in 1997), Latvia (in 1998), Bulgaria (in 2000),
Germany (in 2000), Israel (in 2000), Iceland (in 2003), Romania (in 2004), Ukraine

2007), and Venezuela (in 2007; <a href="#c91">Global
Initiative, 2007b</a>). The latter three bans are significant
because they are the first universal bans on corporal punishment of children in the
Western hemisphere. We describe Sweden's ban in depth here both because it is the
first and because it remains the most studied of the bans.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The First Country to Institute a Universal Ban: Sweden</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Sweden was not
always a country inimical to corporal punishment of children. In fact, corporal
punishment with either parents' hands or objects was widely practiced by parents
at least until the 1950s (<a href="#c68">Durrant,
2003</a>; <a href="#c194">Stattin,
Janson, Klackenberg-Larsson, &amp; Magnusson, 1995</a>).
As in the United States, much of the support for corporal punishment as a
component of child rearing in Sweden was rooted in religious beliefs and literal
interpretations of religious texts (<a href="#c29">Boyson, 2002</a>). However, support for corporal punishment
of children increasingly waned throughout the 20th century as the Swedish
government became concerned with children's rights, among them the right to
equal treatment under the law. In 1957, Sweden eliminated the criminal defense
to corrective assault of a child (i.e., corporal punishment). Then, in 1966, the
exemption for mild corporal punishment was removed from the civil code. The
effect of these two reforms was to make the hitting of children a criminal
assault equivalent to a prosecutable assault of an adult. At this time, one half
of the Swedish population still believed that corporal punishment was necessary
in child rearing (<a href="#c68">Durrant,
2003</a>), reflecting the fact that the government based these
decisions on social science research findings and human rights principles, not
on popular opinion.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The stage for a
complete ban on corporal punishment was set in the early 1970s when public
outrage at a few high-profile cases of child physical abuse, including one in
which a father was acquitted of assault because he claimed to be disciplining
the child, led to the creation of the Children's Rights Commission in 1977
(<a href="#c29">Boyson, 2002</a>;
<a href="#c68">Durrant, 2003</a>).
This commission, made up of lawyers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and
politicians, issued a report arguing that a ban on corporal punishment was
necessary to promote children's healthy development, to prevent abuse, and to
teach the public that all violence against children is unacceptable
(<a href="#c107">Hindberg,
2001</a>). In direct response to this report, the Swedish
parliament amended the country's civil law code to explicitly prohibit corporal
punishment of children by all adults. The language was further amended by
parliament in 1983 such that it now reads, “Children are entitled to
care, security, and a good upbringing. Children are to be treated with respect
for their person and individuality and may not be subjected to physical
punishment or any other injurious or humiliating treatment”
(<a href="#c78">Föräldrabalk
[Code Relating to Parents, Guardians, and Children] 6:1
(Swed.)</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Swedish
legal system has separate civil and criminal codes that sometimes complement and
interact with each other. The civil code ban on all corporal punishment of
children exemplifies this dynamic. Swedish legislators placed the ban in the
civil code for the dual purposes of unmistakably conveying the government's
strict position against the punishment and reassuring potential violators that
the government preferred to educate, rather than prosecute, them into
compliance. Nevertheless, under the criminal code, adults still can be
prosecuted for assault if they violate the civil code ban on corporal punishment
(<a href="#c30">Brottsbalken [Criminal Code] 3:5
(Swed.)</a>; see <a href="#c26">Bitensky, 2006</a>, for analysis). This option is rarely
used in relation to light parental corporal punishment. The Swedish government
pursues a policy of prosecutorial restraint under this circumstance, trusting
instead to the gradual pedagogical effect of the civil ban working in tandem
with the possibility (however remote) of criminal prosecution. Law reform in
Sweden, both criminal and civil, was intended to set a clear standard for
parents and society, affirm children's rights to protection, and change public
attitudes over time about the acceptability of corporal punishment, with the
expectation that changes in behavior would follow (<a href="#c218">Ziegert, 1983</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To achieve this
goal, the government began a universal campaign to educate the public about the
civil code ban. The main thrust of the campaign was the distribution of booklets
that advise parents about the rationale for the law, the reasons for avoiding
corporal punishment, and suggestions for alternative approaches to resolving
parent–child conflict. The booklets were available in Swedish and 10
minority languages. In an effort to extend this education to children directly,
information about the new law appeared on milk cartons for 2 months after the
law passed, and the law was discussed in family life classes in Swedish schools.
The education campaign was amazingly successful, with 99% of the public aware of
the law after only 2 years, an unprecedented level of public awareness of any
law throughout the industrialized world (<a href="#c218">Ziegert, 1983</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The ban appears
to have been successful both in changing attitudes about corporal punishment as
an acceptable discipline practice and in changing the incidence of it. The
percentage of adults who profess positive attitudes toward spanking has declined
from over 50% in the 1970s before the ban to close to 10% in 2000
(<a href="#c119">Janson,
2005</a>). Even more impressive is the low support for corporal
punishment among children after the ban. In a 1994–1995 survey, among
both respondents who were 18 to 34 years old (and, thus, children when the ban
went into effect) and respondents who were then 13- to 15-year-old children
(born after the 1979 ban), only 6% approved of the use of mild forms of corporal
punishment (<a href="#c68">Durrant,
2003</a>). Use of corporal punishment has also declined
dramatically, although it has not disappeared: Whereas 51% of all preschool
children had experienced corporal punishment in 1980, only 8% had by 2000
(<a href="#c119">Janson,
2005</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the 2
decades after the ban, child injuries from assaults also decreased
(<a href="#c66">Durrant,
1999</a>). Child deaths from assaults were already so low in
Sweden (never having exceeded one death per year since 1971) that this indicator
was unaffected by the ban. Although reports of assaults against children
increased after the ban went into effect, the vast majority (92%) of these
involved minor assaults, which suggests that potentially harmful parent
behaviors are identified before injury occurs (<a href="#c66">Durrant, 1999</a>). Given that increased awareness
about violence against children was a primary goal of the ban, it is
unsurprising that the number of assaults (physical abuse) against children
reported to authorities increased after the ban (<a href="#c66">Durrant, 1999</a>). A committee convened by the
government in 1998 to investigate the rise in abuse reporting concluded that the
rise was not attributable to an increase in actual abuse but only to the
reporting of it (<a href="#c29">Boyson,
2002</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One final
outcome of note is the effect of the ban on youth problem behaviors. Detractors
of the ban argued that it would result in an increase in youth violence and
delinquency, worrying that parents who do not use corporal punishment would be
too permissive. On the contrary, youth involvement in theft, drug use, and drug
trafficking declined following the ban (<a href="#c67">Durrant, 2000</a>). Youth suicide also declined
(<a href="#c67">Durrant,
2000</a>). There was, however, an increase in reporting of
violent assaults by youth after the ban. This increase has been found to be
primarily the result of a growing societal intolerance for all violence against
children, including that perpetrated by other children, an intolerance that was
advanced in several ways in the years after the ban including through
antibullying initiatives in schools (<a href="#c67">Durrant, 2000</a>).</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Subsequent Bans of All Corporal Punishment</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the years
since Sweden's ban, 22 additional countries have instituted bans of all corporal
punishment, either through legislation or supreme court decision. In the
countries that have universal bans, legal reform toward a ban has usually tended
to progress through three stages (<a href="#c29">Boyson, 2002</a>; <a href="#c91">Global Initiative, 2007b</a>). The first stage has often
been to prohibit corporal punishment in schools, child care centers, and all
nonfamily settings that care for children. The second stage has been to remove
corporal punishment of children as a defense to assault charges. The third stage
has been an explicit and complete prohibition of any violence against children,
including corporal punishment, typically in civil rather than criminal law
codes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Most of the
bans are similar to Sweden's in that offenders can be prosecuted under assault
or assault-related statutes but also in that prosecutorial restraint is
government policy. These governments view the bans as having mainly a
pedagogical role. Many of these countries have supplemented the legal bans with
national campaigns to inform the public about the existence of the bans, the
potential harm of corporal punishment, and effective disciplinary alternatives
(<a href="#c29">Boyson, 2002</a>).
The strength of these pedagogical efforts has varied from country to country,
usually in relation to the amount of governmental resources and political
commitment devoted to the campaigns. Germany, for example, followed its 2000 ban
by mounting a significant mass media campaign and by producing educational
materials for parents, including the distribution of one million packets to
parents about developmental milestones and ways of avoiding corporal punishment
(<a href="#c29">Boyson, 2002</a>).
Yet the ban had modest effects in the 2 years after its enactment; rates of
severe corporal punishment (hitting with a rod or hitting so hard as to leave
bruises) decreased dramatically, but overall support for and use of milder forms
of corporal punishment have not declined (<a href="#c32">Bussman, 2004</a>). This finding has been
attributed to the fact that, despite government efforts at a national publicity
campaign, only a third of the population surveyed was aware of the ban
(<a href="#c32">Bussman,
2004</a>). Educating the public is clearly essential when laws
are meant to have educational rather than prosecutorial value.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Italy, legal
developments have been confusing. The Italian supreme court has issued a ruling
prohibiting all corporal punishment of children (<a href="#c221">Cass., 1996</a>). However, because the decision
was rendered in a civil-law system (rather than in a common-law system, such as
that of the United States), the decision has no binding precedential effect
except upon the parties to the litigation. The result is that parental corporal
punishment remains legal in Italy (<a href="#c26">Bitensky, 2006</a>). For the ruling to become law, it must
be confirmed through changes in legislation.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_116" title="Program and Policy Strategies to Reduce Corporal Punishment of Children in the&#xA;United States">Program and Policy Strategies to Reduce Corporal Punishment of Children in the

evidence on the intended and unintended effects of corporal punishment and the
connection between use of corporal punishment and physical abuse of children
indicate that there is little empirical evidence of benefit and substantial evidence
of potential harm from corporal punishment. The growing consensus in the
international human rights community that corporal punishment of children
constitutes a human rights violation speaks for itself. In most American
jurisdictions, the fluctuating dividing line between legal corporal punishment and
criminal physical abuse leaves caregivers with unpredictable standards for
disciplining children. Both the social science and legal arguments point to a
similar conclusion: The risks of corporal punishment outweigh any perceived benefits
to children or to parents. From a legal and public health point of view, parents and
other adults who interact with children should be encouraged to reduce their use of
corporal punishment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To have all
Americans embrace the goal of reducing and, in the long run, potentially eliminating
corporal punishment of children, a multilayered strategy of interventions is
necessary. We recommend such a set of strategies here. Education should be the key

strategies discussed.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EDBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Strategy 1: Universal Prevention—Education Campaign on Effective
Discipline</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A universal, or
primary, approach to preventing or reducing parents' use of corporal punishment
would be to educate the general public about its risks and about the benefits of
using other discipline techniques. Such an approach has the benefit of providing
a consistent message to all current and potential parents in the United States
and of not merely targeting particular populations who will feel labeled as
potential abusers. The main goals of such a universal approach would be to
change norms about the acceptability and utility of corporal punishment and to
increase knowledge of effective nonviolent forms of discipline.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An example of
an effective, countrywide effort to reduce corporal punishment is the
“Hitting Children Must Stop. FULL STOP” campaign in the
United Kingdom led by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children (NSPCC). The NSPCC based the campaign in part on research findings that
high percentages of parents reported their own negative reactions to having used
corporal punishment with their children: Afterwards, 79% felt upset, 73% felt
sad, 67% felt regretful, and 65% felt guilty (<a href="#c153">NSPCC, 2002b</a>). The aims of the campaign were
to educate the public about the ineffectiveness and potential dangerousness of
corporal punishment and about alternative positive discipline techniques
(<a href="#c180">Sajkowska &amp; Wojtasik,
2004</a>). The campaign involved posters on billboards
across the country for a month, a public service announcement on radio stations
for 2 weeks, and an educational booklet for parents called <em>Encouraging
Better Behaviour: A Practical Guide to Parenting</em>
(<a href="#c152">NSPCC,
2002a</a>). The campaign was very successful in meeting its
goals. A survey after the campaign ended revealed that 65% of adults in the
United Kingdom noticed the campaign and that 63% understood that a key message
of the campaign was that hitting children is wrong and unproductive
(<a href="#c180">Sajkowska &amp; Wojtasik,
2004</a>). In subsequent evaluations of the continuing
campaign, the percentage of adults who said that protecting children from harm
was one of their top three social concerns went from 38% in 1999 (before the
campaign) to 87% in 2006; furthermore, 67% of adults in 2006 agreed that
children should have the same protection from assault as adults
(<a href="#c154">NSPCC,
2007</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Here in the
United States, an organization known by the acronym EPOCH-USA (End Physical
Punishment of Children) has, since 1998, sponsored SpankOut Day USA on April
30th of each year. The goal of SpankOut Day USA is to encourage parents to
refrain from using corporal punishment on that day and to consider alternative
forms of discipline through the organization of community-based activities and
distribution of educational materials (<a href="#c40">Center for Effective Discipline, 2007d</a>). Although
related events are held each year around the country, the reach of SpankOut Day
USA thus far remains relatively modest.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Would a
coordinated national campaign to persuade parents and other caregivers to
abandon corporal punishment in favor of other discipline techniques be
successful? There are two major reasons to think so. The first is that parents
rely in large numbers on parenting magazines and books for advice on
disciplining their children (<a href="#c12">Ateah,
2003</a>). They are clearly open to and in fact seek out
parenting advice from individuals and organizations outside the immediate
family. The second reason is that, although Americans are typically loath to
have the government interfere in families' everyday lives and may not be overly
receptive to government calls to change their parenting behavior, there is
substantial evidence that government-sponsored education campaigns can indeed
change behavior, including that related to child rearing. Public service
advertising has a long and proud history in the United States of using media to
achieve universal education, beginning with the “Loose Lips Sink
Ships” campaign of World War II (<a href="#c3">Ad Council, 2004</a>). Public service advertising
campaigns spearheaded by the nonprofit Ad Council have been responsible for
remarkable changes in Americans' behavior, including increasing seat belt usage
from 21% to 79% over a 10-year period (<a href="#c3">Ad
Council, 2004</a>). Such campaigns, in tandem with new laws
requiring seat belt usage, were instrumental in motivating the ensuing behavior
change (<a href="#c150">National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, 2003</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An example of a
very successful public education campaign specific to child rearing is the
“Back to Sleep” campaign cosponsored by the American Academy
of Pediatrics, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the
SIDS Alliance, the Association of SIDS and Infant Mortality Programs, and the
Maternal and Child Health Bureau. In the first 10 years after the campaign was
begun in 1994, the percentage of children being put to sleep on their backs
increased from 17% to 73% (a 429% increase) while the SIDS rate decreased by 53%
(<a href="#c8">American Academy of Pediatrics, Task
Force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, 2005</a>;
<a href="#c151">National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, 2006</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several recent
publications from European-based or U.N.-based organizations have outlined the
components necessary for successful campaigns to end corporal punishment. Two
books published by the Council of Europe (<a href="#c56">Council of Europe, 2005</a>; <a href="#c180">Sajkowska &amp; Wojtasik,
2004</a>) and a third jointly produced by the <a href="#c92">Global Initiative and Save the Children
(2002)</a> provided concrete suggestions for and examples of
awareness-raising campaigns. A publication issued by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (<a href="#c105">Hart, 2005</a>) summarized the human
rights arguments and empirical evidence against corporal punishment and
delineated principles of constructive discipline that are based on standards
from the <a href="#c207">Children's Convention
(1989)</a>. The most comprehensive manual, prepared by Save
the Children (<a href="#c104">Harper et al.,
2005</a>), went farther, detailing five steps needed to
effectuate change in attitudes about and use of corporal punishment: (a)
understanding the problem (its prevalence, why it should be eliminated), (b)
committing to change (at individual, organization, and state levels), (c)
situation analysis (including talking with children about their experiences and
conducting a comprehensive review of the contexts that promote corporal
punishment), (d) delivering the change for children (through legal reform and
public education efforts that involve child participation), and (e) impact
assessment (with baseline data, process indicators, and evaluation of relevant
programs). Each of these publications provides practical advice to those who
might plan a campaign to reduce corporal punishment in the United States</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To be
successful in changing Americans' attitudes and behavior regarding corporal
punishment, a campaign would likely have to have three integral components. One
would be an emphasis on effective, nonviolent alternatives and on the benefits
to parents and their children that will be associated with the change in
parental disciplining. Many parents will need help in identifying methods to use
instead of corporal punishment and may need some convincing that such methods
will be successful in reducing child misbehavior, promoting child positive
behavior, and eliminating potential risks to children, such as illegal physical
abuse. A recently published exemplar of how to present such methods to parents
is a manual commissioned by the Global Initiative and Save the Children Sweden
entitled <em>Positive Discipline: What It Is and How to Do It</em>
(<a href="#c70">Durrant,
2007</a>). This manual, written in clear language with simple
exercises to facilitate learning, guides parents in assimilating what are called
the four principles of positive discipline, namely, setting goals, creating a
positive home climate, understanding how children think and feel, and solving
problems in difficult situations. Although quite long (at 356 pages), it
provides a comprehensive introduction to and instruction in positive discipline
for parents.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A second
component would consist of messages and materials developed by and for specific
racial, ethnic–cultural, religious, or socioeconomic groups that have
traditionally favored the use of corporal punishment. Educational materials must
be respectful of the beliefs and opinions of these groups. The materials should
ideally be prepared by group members to ensure that information and advice are
nonjudgmental and are focused on promoting positive alternatives to corporal
punishment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third,
educational materials will be all the more convincing if they also present
children's perspectives on corporal punishment (<a href="#c169">Phillips &amp; Alderson, 2003</a>). In
qualitative interviews, children reported feeling sad, angry, fearful, and
estranged from their parents after being physically punished and expressed their
disquietude at an inherent unfairness in the fact that adults can hit children
but not other adults (<a href="#c63">Dobbs, Smith,
&amp; Taylor, 2006</a>; <a href="#c216">Willow &amp; Hyder, 1998</a>). Given the U.K.
findings that the vast majority of parents reported feeling sadness, regret, and
guilt after using corporal punishment (<a href="#c153">NSPCC, 2002b</a>) and the fact that their
perception of the negative effects of corporal punishment on children is the
main reason parents report ceasing to use it (<a href="#c111">Holden, Thompson, Zambarano, &amp; Marshall,
1997</a>), educational materials that emphasize children's
emotional reactions to being physically punished could be particularly effective
in encouraging parents to think twice about using the practice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mounting a
universal education campaign in a large and diverse nation such as the United
States is indeed a daunting task, as well as an expensive one. The costs for the
Ad Council's creation of a public service advertising campaign from scratch and
promotion of it over 3 years are estimated at a minimum of approximately $2
million (<a href="#c4">Ad Council,
2007</a>). Yet, if considered as furthering prevention of child
abuse, the costs of a campaign to reduce corporal punishment are dwarfed by the
costs of child maltreatment to states and to the nation, which have been
estimated to be $66.8 million per day to maintain the current system of child
protection (<a href="#c80">Fromm,
2001</a>). Clearly, a national education campaign would be money
well spent if it helped reduce the monumental costs of maltreatment to society,
let alone the human costs to child victims.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0ECBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Strategy 2: Targeted Interventions for New Parents, Pre-Parents, and At-Risk
Parents</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While a
universal campaign is crucial for changing the national conversation about
discipline and may be sufficient for some parents to reduce or stop their use of
corporal punishment, changing actual discipline behavior for other parents may
require more intensive interventions. Because altering established behavior
patterns is difficult (<a href="#c166">Patterson,
1982</a>), many such interventions should be preventive,
targeting individuals before they become parents. With more and more adults
attending childbirth classes before the arrival of their first child, such
classes would be an ideal setting to encourage parents to reevaluate their
beliefs about corporal punishment and to deter them from using it with their own
children. Another preventive approach would be to include curriculum on
effective alternatives to corporal punishment in family life courses in high
schools. Other potential avenues for targeted education about effective
nonviolent discipline include foster and adoptive parent preparation programs,
orientation materials and programs provided to new U.S. residents, and
babysitting training courses (<a href="#c71">Durrant,
Ensom, &amp; the Coalition on Physical Punishment of Children and Youth,
2004</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of course,
parents are likely to be more interested in discussing discipline when they are
faced with the challenges of daily child rearing. Many parents recognize that
corporal punishment exacerbates, rather than improves, child behavior and
acknowledge a decision not to use it because of their children's negative
reactions to being physically punished (<a href="#c111">Holden et al., 1997</a>). This circumstance, in
conjunction with the fact that parents seek out parenting information from
multiple sources (<a href="#c12">Ateah,
2003</a>), suggests that many American parents may be desirous
of information about nonviolent alternatives to corporal punishment. A way to
provide such information would be through universally available parenting
education programs offered to all parents and caregivers, perhaps through child
care centers, schools, YMCAs, community centers, and faith-based outreach
centers. Such programs could provide guidance on developmentally appropriate
expectations for children's behavior as well as strategies for preventing child
misbehavior and for using nonviolent discipline when parent–child
conflict occurs. The funding and oversight for such programs should come from
federal, state, and local governments to ensure that such parenting education is
truly available to all who want it. Of course, nongovernmental funding, such as
from private companies and foundations, would also help ensure universal
availability of parenting education.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A third
targeted approach would be what is known as tertiary prevention, in other words,
targeted at parents who have already been identified as having physically abused
their children. There are already a variety of programs throughout the country
aimed at reducing abusive behaviors by maltreating parents, and many of the
curricula for these programs include an emphasis on reducing corporal punishment
and on increasing nonpunitive discipline techniques. Current approaches among
interventions targeted to maltreating parents include parenting groups run by
fellow parents, home visitation programs, and parent mentor programs, in which
nonabusive parents serve as role models for parents who have abused their
children (<a href="#c93">Goldman et al.,
2003</a>). It should be noted, though, that not all such
programs have been shown to significantly reduce maltreatment in randomized
controlled trials (<a href="#c41">Chaffin &amp;
Schmidt, 2006</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One promising
example of a parenting intervention that includes both universal and targeted
components is the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program (<a href="#c181">Sanders, Markie-Dadds, &amp; Turner,
2003</a>). The intervention is designed with five levels of
intensity, beginning with a media-based universal campaign to educate the public
about the program (Level 1) and ending with individually tailored home visits
and trainings (Level 5). Included in the program is instruction in alternatives
to coercive discipline practices such as corporal punishment. Randomized
controlled trials of Triple P have demonstrated its effectiveness in achieving
reliable decreases in children's problematic behaviors (<a href="#c181">Sanders et al., 2003</a>). The
Triple P is currently being offered as a population-based intervention in 18
counties in South Carolina, involving more than 12,000 families to date
(<a href="#c192">Stambor,
2006</a>). If the program continues to be effective on this
large scale, the Triple P could be used at the state level as a means of
promoting alternatives to corporal punishment and of intervening in families
before corporal punishment becomes routine.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EBBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Strategy 3: Education for Professionals Who Work With Children and Families</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Professionals
who work directly with children and families, including teachers, child care
providers, doctors, psychologists, and social workers, are in good positions to
provide education to parents regarding effective discipline. The same reasons
that these professionals are legally bound to be mandated reporters, namely,
that they have frequent contacts with families and are trusted by them, make
them preferred sources of preventive education on alternatives to corporal
punishment (what the field of medicine calls anticipatory guidance).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mandated
reporters are professionals who work directly with children and families and who
are required by law to report any and all suspected cases of child abuse or
neglect to child protective services (<a href="#c42">Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act,
1974</a>; <a href="#c205">U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Children, Youth
and Families, Children's Bureau, 2005b</a>). Nationally, 56%
of child abuse and neglect reports come from mandated reporters such as
teachers, law enforcement officers, social workers, health care workers, and
child care providers (<a href="#c203">U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, 2006</a>). Yet there is not
universal agreement among these mandated reporters regarding what constitutes
reportable abusive behavior (<a href="#c6">Alvarez,
Kenny, &amp; Donohue, 2004</a>; <a href="#c10">Ashton, 1999</a>, <a href="#c11">2001</a>; <a href="#c183">Schenck, Lyman, &amp; Bodin,
2000</a>). Training in what constitutes reportable abuse is
minimal in some fields (e.g., 2 hours in New York state for teachers and nurses;
<a href="#c28">Bluestone,
2005</a>), if it exists at all. Some professional organizations
publish guidelines for how their members should address the topic of discipline
with parents, including discouraging the use of corporal punishment (see the
<a href="#c7">American Academy of Pediatrics,
Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health,
1998</a>). However, not all professional organizations whose
members interact with parents and children provide such explicit guidance.
Instead, individuals are left to draw upon their own experience in making such
judgments (<a href="#c123">Kalichman,
1999</a>). In practice, mandated reporters who themselves hold
favorable views of corporal punishment are less likely to deem even clearly
injurious parenting behaviors (e.g., burning a child with a cigarette) as
abusive and are less likely to report such incidents to child protection
authorities (<a href="#c11">Ashton,
2001</a>; <a href="#c28">Bluestone,
2005</a>). In trusting these potential reporters with the
welfare of its children, society should do more to standardize criteria for
substantiating physical abuse and to enlighten the public about the potential
for corporal punishment to result in physical injury.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the
thought of coordinating the training of thousands of professionals throughout
the country is overwhelming, there is an example of such training being
conducted on a national scale, albeit in a country smaller than the United
States. In Norway, the Ministry of Child and Family Affairs has successfully
achieved nationwide implementation of the parent management training program
developed at the Oregon Social Learning Center (<a href="#c161">Ogden, Forgatch, Askeland, Patterson, &amp; Bullock,
2005</a>). Through coordination at county and municipal levels,
professionals throughout the country have been trained in the program. The
effectiveness of this national intervention in impacting parenting practices and
child outcomes is currently being evaluated, but anecdotal evidence from media
reports suggests the program has been well received by families
(<a href="#c161">Ogden et al.,
2005</a>). The vastness of the United States and the
concentration of child protection at the state level would make a single
national effort to accomplish such training difficult, but the Norwegian example
indicates interventions at the state level could be feasible. Federal block
grants to states could be used to fund such training efforts, in a similar
fashion to the welfare reform block grants begun in 1996.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EABCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Strategy 4: Reforming Federal and State Laws Regarding Corporal Punishment</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The fact that
more than half of all states have banned corporal punishment in public schools
(see <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>) indicates that the majority of the country
now disapproves of school-based corporal punishment. As remarked above, less
than a quarter of adult Americans agree that it is acceptable for a teacher to
use corporal punishment (<a href="#c198">SurveyUSA,
2005</a>). A long list of influential and well-respected
professional and nonprofit organizations has called for a ban of corporal
punishment in schools (<a href="#c38">Center for
Effective Discipline, 2007b</a>). In addition, school
administrators have expressed doubt about the practice; a 1997 survey of all
school administrators in a Florida county found that corporal punishment was
rated by them as not at all effective and as the least effective of 14 student
disciplinary methods (<a href="#c173">Raffaele,
1999</a>). Unfortunately, the policy debate about school
corporal punishment has largely been one of opinions and anecdotal evidence. For
example, <a href="#c188">Smith
(1996)</a> documented such a debate within an Ohio school
district in which principals' anecdotal reports took precedence over social
scientists' research evidence. This reliance on personal experience over
empirical data clouds the discussion about the professed benefits and
demonstrated detriments of school corporal punishment. Yet, as school corporal
punishment continues to be debated by average citizens and school personnel
across the United States and as international condemnation of the punishment
seeps into public consciousness, the 22 states that currently permit the
practice will undoubtedly be pushed to reassess their current policies. Just in
the past year, bills were introduced in both North Carolina (H.B. 853:
<a href="#c2">An Act to Prohibit the Use of
Corporal Punishment in the Public Schools, 2007</a>) and
Texas (H.B. 379: <a href="#c1">An Act Relating to
Corporal Punishment in Public Schools, 2007</a>) to ban
school corporal punishment. Although they sparked debate in their respective
states, the North Carolina bill failed, and the Texas bill was not brought up
for a vote.<br /><br /><a id="tbl2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/9a65c55fb040ea384b43f5255e9342cf/571cbbed/pdh/law/law-13-4-231-tbl2a.gif" alt="law-13-4-231-tbl2a.gif" title="Legal Status of Corporal Punishment in Public Schools Across the United States" /><em>Legal Status of Corporal Punishment in Public Schools Across the United States</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Dismantling
legal sanction of parents' use of corporal punishment would optimally entail two
legal strategies working in tandem. One would be a congressionally enacted
universal ban that, because of its source and national applicability, would
provide the most consistent and persuasive message. However, national
legislation is unlikely because of legal and political considerations. State
legislatures are, therefore, the most appropriate forum for banning all corporal
punishment of children (<a href="#c171">Pollard,
2002</a>). The second strategy would be the removal of the
defense of corporal punishment of children such that the punishment attains the
status of criminal assault or child abuse. (When a defendant hits a child and is
charged with these crimes, he or she may currently use this defense to avoid
liability on the theory that he or she was only disciplining the child.) This is
a necessary step in protecting children, though, if the experience of other
countries is any indication, it would be insufficient by itself to achieve
widespread attitudinal and behavioral change in the public.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Incidentally,
these legal reforms would not objectionably impinge on family privacy or
parental prerogative. There simply is no fundamental amorphous family privacy
right or a fundamental parental right to spank children under the federal
Constitution. Nor is the experience of governmental intervention in the family,
to advance children's welfare, foreign to Americans. Laws in the United States
prescribe, for instance, when children may drive, drink, marry, contract, enter
the armed forces, and go to school, as well as the standards for their education
and the vaccinations prerequisite to school attendance. From a less legalistic
standpoint, it is edifying to remember that once lawmakers have decided certain
conduct, such as child abuse or wife beating, is detrimental and unacceptable,
with the passage of time the average citizen does not ultimately see the
resulting laws outlawing the conduct as invasions of privacy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Universal and
explicit state bans, however, would have the power to effectuate such a
transformation. We know this from the operation of other American laws that do
not involve much, or any, enforcement but that nevertheless have had a
far-reaching effect on individual behavior. A prominent example of this
phenomenon is that of antismoking ordinances in the United States. There are no
smoking police who go around stubbing out cigarettes and issuing citations in
nonsmoking zones. Rather, the laws are considered self-enforcing because over
time the norms are internalized (<a href="#c26">Bitensky, 2006</a>). Other examples of laws that typically
involve little enforcement but have still been successful in changing public
behavior are carpool lanes for drivers, pooper-scooper laws for dog owners, and
child safety seat laws for families (<a href="#c26">Bitensky, 2006</a>). Thus, there is precedent in the United
States for legislation that achieves its purpose by educating rather than
penalizing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although there
may not be a groundswell of support in the American public for universal bans,
that does not mean that reform of this nature is impossible in the future. It is
worth noting that among the countries that have instituted bans on corporal
punishment, public opinion in support of a ban has not been a prerequisite
(<a href="#c29">Boyson, 2002</a>).
In Sweden, for example, more than half of adults expressed positive attitudes
about corporal punishment before the universal ban was passed as legislation. An
American analogue can be found with regard to school corporal punishment:
Although a survey of Memphis parents found that 75% supported corporal
punishment in schools, Memphis City Schools proceeded to ban the practice in
2004 (<a href="#c147">Memphis City Schools Board of
Education, 2004</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It undoubtedly
helps to have public opinion on the side of legislation, both to get it passed
and to ensure compliance with it. A sea change in Americans' attitudes about
corporal punishment would thus be helpful. Although achieving such a drastic
change in entrenched attitudes seems a tall order for abolitionists, such
about-faces have taken place before and on similar issues. The most germane
example is public opinion in the United States about domestic violence. As part
of the growing influence of feminism in the 1970s, the women's movement
successfully changed public opinion about the acceptability of assaults on women
by their husbands or partners, prompted the creation of shelters for battered
women and their children, and advocated for legal reforms at local, state, and
federal levels (<a href="#c182">Schechter,
1982</a>). A similar sea change in the still pervasive belief
that parents have the right to hit their children may or may not be needed
before laws prohibiting corporal punishment will be seriously considered in this
country; certainly, a pre-reform attitudinal shift would be preferable.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_152" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">No doubt, there are
many citizens, academics and nonacademics alike, who strongly disagree with a
conclusion that corporal punishment should be banned in this country. Any such
disagreement should not be taken lightly, particularly in view of the fact that
corporal punishment remains widely used by parents throughout the United States.
With this in mind, supporters of a circumscribed role for policy intervention in
families have cautioned, 
<blockquote>The customs
and laws of a society should be given due respect and consideration before
banning or stigmatizing a practice, such as physical punishment, that most
members practice and consider useful in accomplishing their goals,
<i>provided that there is no ethical objection to these
goals</i> [italics added]. (Baumrind &amp; Thompson, 2002, p. 16)</blockquote> This of course raises the question, Can or should the corporal
punishment of children be considered an ethical issue?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">International human
rights law has its historical roots in religious and philosophical concepts of
morality, social justice, and right treatment. The fact that corporal punishment has
come to be considered a violation of the world's major human rights treaties
manifests the international community's judgment that this disciplinary practice is
at its core unethical and morally indefensible.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Beginning with the
first federal <a href="#c42">Child Abuse Prevention and
Treatment Act (1974)</a>, the U.S. government has accepted
without reservation its ethical and legal obligations to ensure that children's
basic needs are fulfilled, that children are protected from harm, and that parents
are supported in meeting these basic needs through assistance, prevention, and
intervention (<a href="#c93">Goldman et al.,
2003</a>). If federal and state governments take seriously their
mandate to prevent child abuse, preventing corporal punishment should be a clear way
to reduce abusive assaults against children. Moreover, a ban on corporal punishment
would resolve the current confusion and risk created by a legal system that
capriciously and unpredictably permits certain forms of physical violence against
children but not others. The mixed messages such laws give to both children and
parents would be resolved by laws that prohibit all violence against children.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It was only by
transforming attitudes so as to repudiate husbands' right to hit their wives and by
removing societal and legal approval of such behavior that domestic violence against
women substantially decreased (<a href="#c130">Lansdown,
2000</a>; <a href="#c182">Schechter,
1982</a>). The time is long overdue for similar scrutiny to be
turned upon parents' right to hit their children. In 2004 alone, 422 children died
in the United States as a direct result of physical abuse by parents; in an
additional 450 child deaths, physical abuse may have been combined with other forms
of maltreatment to cause the child's death (<a href="#c203">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for
Children and Families, 2006</a>). Every one of these child
deaths was preventable. The established connections between corporal punishment and
physical abuse behoove all states to work towards reducing corporal punishment. As a
result of their developing and vulnerable status, children should be afforded more,
not less, protection under the laws and social policies of the United States.</p><a id="law-13-4-231-ID0E06G0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_159" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>An Act Relating to Corporal Punishment in Public
