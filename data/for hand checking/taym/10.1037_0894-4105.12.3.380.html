Although the two hemispheres are functionally specialized, they are also strongly interconnected by over 200 million nerve fibers, which enables them to integrate information and produces strong bihemispheric activation during most tasks, including “lateralized” ones such as speaking (e.g., <a href="#c44">Lassen, Ingvar, &amp; Skinhoj, 1978</a>). In recent years, a significant effort has been dedicated to understanding the role of interhemispheric interaction on cognition. To clearly understand how the independent and specialized processing capacities of the hemispheres affect information processing, we must also understand how the hemispheres communicate, the costs and benefits of their interaction, and how the factors modulate the relative balance between these two outcomes. Hence, we must elucidate the implications of interhemispheric information processing for task performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This study investigated the dynamics of interhemispheric integration of information and its effects on performance. We demonstrate that interhemispheric interaction increases the brain's information-processing capability during complex tasks by allowing the distribution of computations between the hemispheres. We further present evidence that the advantages of interhemispheric interaction can be constrained by effects of individual differences in asymmetric hemispheric activation and, in some very restricted cases, by the lateralization of the computations required to perform a task.</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_11" title="From Hemispheric Autonomy to Interhemispheric Networks">From Hemispheric Autonomy to Interhemispheric Networks</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Early studies investigating neurologically intact individuals and split-brain patients alike demonstrated that the hemispheres not only have their preferred mode of operation (left–verbal, right–spatial) but also rely upon independent resources (<a href="#c13">Brooks, 1968</a>; <a href="#c41">Kinsbourne &amp; Hicks, 1978</a>, e.g. <a href="#c42">Kreuter, Kinsbourne, &amp; Trevarthen, 1972</a>) to enable them to perform certain operations simultaneously with relatively little interference. For example, simultaneous performance of two verbal tasks yields greater dual-task interference than performance of a verbal and a visuospatial task, which would rely upon distinct left- and right-hemispheric resources, respectively (<a href="#c71">Wickens, 1980</a>; <a href="#c72">Wickens &amp; Liu, 1988</a>; <a href="#c33">Herdman &amp; Friedman, 1985</a>; <a href="#c25">Friedman &amp; Polson, 1981</a>; <a href="#c64">Polson &amp; Friedman, 1988</a>). This independence of resources raises the issue of how processing is coordinated and integrated across the hemispheres. Although having specialized processors enables various aspects of tasks to be distributed and performed in parallel, there is also a cost associated with translating and integrating outputs of different modules. Such costs associated with parallel information processing in the brain have been described by<a href="#c60">Nelson and Bowers (1990)</a>
as they apply to parallel computer maps. One major obstacle to achieving optimal performance is <em>communication overhead,</em>  which is the cost of integrating information between a number of processing units. Such integration is time consuming, and the characteristics of the connections may degrade the resolution of the information to be communicated. Empirical evidence suggests that a certain amount of information loss and degradation is also found during interhemispheric information processing (e.g., <a href="#c3">Banich &amp; Belger, 1991</a>). Hence, interhemispheric processing may either improve or hinder performance depending on the relative benefit afforded by parallel computing across the hemispheres as compared to the relative cost of the communication overhead involved in coordinating the outputs of the two hemispheres.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recent studies that addressed this networking issue by examining the effects of interhemispheric interaction on performance have yielded conflicting results; some showed that dividing information between the hemispheres improves performance and others reported that interhemispheric processing hinders performance. Comparison of split-brain patients to neurologically intact individuals provides a direct evaluation of the relative costs or benefits of interhemispheric communication on cognitive performance, because these patients lack all interhemispheric communication fibers. However, only some studies found that split-brain patients perform better than neurologically intact individuals (<a href="#c23">Ellenberg &amp; Sperry, 1979</a>, <a href="#c24"> 1980</a>; <a href="#c35">Holtzman &amp; Gazzaniga, 1985</a>), suggesting that (a) the two isolated hemispheres are independent information processors and do not interfere with each other's performance, and (b) disconnection of the hemispheres increases overall processing capacity. Other studies, in contrast, found that neurologically intact individuals perform better than split-brain patients (e.g., <a href="#c42">Kreuter et al., 1972</a>; <a href="#c34">Holtzman &amp; Gazzaniga, 1982</a>), a finding that is attributed to the capability of neurologically intact individuals to coordinate and to distribute information between the two hemispheres via the callosum.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As in studies of split-brain patients, studies of neurologically intact individuals that examined the relative benefits of interhemispheric processing with tachistoscopic methods also yielded conflicting results.

observed that when all the information necessary for a decision is presented simultaneously (0 ms interstimulus interval [ISI]), an across-hemispheres advantage emerges (<a href="#c1">Banich, 1985</a>; <a href="#c16">Davis &amp; Schmit, 1971</a>, <a href="#c17"> 1973</a>; <a href="#c53">Liederman et al., 1986</a>). On the other hand, imposing an ISI between the presentation of the items yields a within-hemisphere advantage. <a href="#c1">Banich (1985)</a>
conceptualized the presentation of information sequentially as a division of the load over time, such that less information needed to be processed at once. Hence, she suggested that dividing the information between the hemispheres enables a distribution of the load and increases parallel processing, which in turn improves overall performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the<a href="#c1">Banich (1985)</a>
study, task load was manipulated by varying ISI, but it can also be varied by manipulating computational complexity, which can be conceptualized as the number and sorts of transformations, operations, or computations that must be performed on an input before a decision can be reached. For example, if one is simply asked to decide if two numbers are physically identical (physical-identity task), the numerals must be perceptually encoded and then a comparison of their form must occur. However, if one is asked to decide if one number is the square of the other, the items must not only be perceptually analyzed but they must be identified and then one must be squared. Thus, the number-squaring task is computationally more complex than the number-identity task as it requires not only the perceptual analysis operation but the squaring operation as well. In a series of recent studies (<a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>; <a href="#c9">Belger &amp; Banich, 1992</a>), we reported an across-hemisphere advantage for relatively complex tasks with multiple operations (ordinal and summation tasks) but with a within-hemisphere advantage for computationally simpler tasks (physical-identity task). Furthermore, by increasing computational complexity at different stages of information processing, we found similar effects on the relative advantages of interhemispheric processing. Thus, a task in which the individual determines whether two of three numbers are physically identical yields a within-hemisphere advantage, a task in which the individual determines whether two of five numbers are physically identical yields an across-hemisphere advantage, and a task in which the individual determines whether two of five numbers have the same name yields an even greater across-hemisphere advantage. Hence, both increasing complexity at the perceptual level by increasing the number of items to be processed (or the memory load of the task) and increasing complexity at the decision level by requiring additional stages of processing (e.g., naming as compared to physical identification) increases the advantage afforded by interhemispheric processing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this article, we propose that the enhanced performance on across-hemisphere trials during the complex tasks in our prior studies can be explained by the ability to distribute the computations over the two hemispheres and to perform operations in a parallel fashion. In support of this explanation, prior studies have provided evidence that interhemispheric interaction facilitates parallel processing of information between the hemispheres during performance of two conflicting tasks (<a href="#c55">Merola &amp; Liederman, 1990</a>) or perceptually interfering tasks (<a href="#c53">Liederman et al., 1986</a>; <a href="#c54">Merola &amp; Liederman, 1985</a>). We further propose that the advantages of networking between the hemispheres are constrained by two factors: (a) the lateralization of the computations required by the task, and (b) the individual differences in hemispheric activation and handedness.</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0EBDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Effects of Task Laterality on the Size of the Across-Hemisphere Advantage</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We propose that the resource characteristics of each hemisphere may in some cases limit the advantage that interhemispheric interaction can provide during the performance of complex tasks. The degree to which portions of a task can rely on each hemisphere's processing resources determines the extent to which distributing task computations between the hemispheres is beneficial to performance. Most cognitive operations can be supported by both hemispheres, and hence during the performance of most complex tasks the load can be divided between the hemispheres. This has been the case for all of the component operations of the tasks used in our previous studies. In contrast, when the processing resources of one hemisphere are critical for making the final decision, then no matter how the input is distributed between the hemispheres, the final outcome will have to await the availability of this single processor. Consequently, if a significant portion of a computationally complex task can only be performed by one hemisphere, then no performance gain would be predicted for across-hemisphere trials relative to within-hemisphere trials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One operation that was demonstrated to be very strongly lateralized in right-handers is grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (<a href="#c67">Rayman &amp; Zaidel, 1991</a>), which is a critical component of rhyming. The strong dependence of rhyming on the left hemisphere (as indicated by split-brain patients' inability to perform this operation when stimuli are displayed in the left visual field, projecting exclusively to the right hemisphere; <a href="#c73">Zaidel &amp; Peters, 1981</a>) creates a situation similar to the load imbalance problem described by<a href="#c60">Nelson and Bowers (1990)</a>, which is considered to be one major source of inefficiency to parallel computing. Load imbalance results from a nonuniform distribution of the processing load, such that certain processors are overloaded as compared to others. Thus, although computations in some processors are completed quite rapidly, such as perceptual identification, the final outcome has to be delayed until the slowest processor completes its computation, in this case the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion operation. Hence, in such a situation, it should not much matter whether the critical information for the task is divided across the hemisphere or just projected to one, since ultimate performance of the task is dependent upon the left hemisphere.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, the computations required by the name-identity and physical-identity tasks used in our prior studies did not depend critically on the processing capabilities of one hemisphere. Evidence suggests that the name-identity task can be performed either by the left hemisphere using phonemic codes or by the right hemisphere via a case transformation (<a href="#c11">Boles &amp; Eveland, 1983</a>). This enabled the computations to be distributed and processed in parallel across the hemispheres. Hence, we suggest that the absence of a load imbalance in the tasks we have used in prior studies is responsible for the across-hemisphere advantage we have observed. In contrast, for a rhyming task, although both hemispheres can do the initial perceptual encoding of the information, the final decision has to await the left hemisphere's completion of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, creating a load imbalance. Despite the complexity of the rhyme task, we predict that the inability to divide processing at the decision level will obstruct the emergence of an across-hemisphere advantage on the rhyme task. This study investigates this prediction by comparing performance on within- and between-hemisphere trials on a tachistoscopic rhyme task and two tasks previously shown to yield across-hemisphere advantages.</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0EADCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Effects of Individual Differences in Hemispheric Laterality on Interhemispheric Information Processing</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although numerous studies have demonstrated that individual differences in age, sex, and handedness modulate laterality effects (e.g., <a href="#c43">Lake &amp; Bryden, 1976</a>), relatively little is known about how these individual differences in brain organization might affect interhemispheric processing. We propose that individual differences will also affect the ability to divide the computations between the hemispheres as a consequence of their direct influence on lateralized processing. More specifically, in this experiment, we concentrated on two factors, asymmetric hemispheric activation (AHA) and handedness, and examined how they can affect interhemispheric information processing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>AHA</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">AHA, which is also referred to as <em>hemispheric arousal asymmetry</em>
or <em>hemispheric reliance</em>
in the literature, corresponds to the tendency of an individual to systematically engage one hemisphere relative to the other during task performance, regardless of task demands (<a href="#c49">Levy, Heller, Banich, &amp; Burton, 1983a</a>). Among right-handers, the degree of AHA is closely related to the perceptual asymmetry on both verbal and nonverbal tasks. For example, it has been found that individuals biased toward right-hemisphere processing exhibit a larger than average left visual field (LVF) advantage on a right-hemisphere task, a LVF advantage on a nonlateralized task, and a smaller than average right visual field (RVF) advantage on a left-hemisphere task. Thus, for all tasks, the individual exhibits greater than average involvement of the right hemisphere. Likewise, individuals biased toward left-hemisphere processing exhibit a larger than average RVF advantage on a right-hemisphere task, a RVF advantage on a nonlateralized task, and a smaller than average LVF advantage on a left-hemisphere task (<a href="#c36">Kim &amp; Levine, 1991a</a>, <a href="#c37"> 1991b</a>; <a href="#c45">Levine, Banich, &amp; Kim, 1987</a>; <a href="#c46">Levine, Banich, &amp; Koch-Weser, 1984</a>; <a href="#c47">Levine, Banich, &amp; Koch-Weser, 1988</a>; <a href="#c49">Levy et al., 1983a</a>). This AHA results in a positive correlation across an individual's perceptual asymmetries on a series of lateralized tasks. Furthermore, 45.2% of between-subjects variations in asymmetry scores has been reported to be attributable to individual differences in AHA (<a href="#c38">Kim, Levine, &amp; Kertesz, 1990</a>). Although right- and left-handers may vary in their patterns of hemispheric asymmetry, the distribution of characteristic perceptual asymmetries does not vary with handedness, such that AHA accounts for the same amount of variance for dextrals and sinistrals (<a href="#c38">Kim et al., 1990</a>). Finally, AHA may be partly due to baseline arousal asymmetries between the hemispheres (e.g., <a href="#c49">Levy et al., 1983a</a>; <a href="#c28">Green, Morris, Epstein, West, &amp; Engler, 1992</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although AHA is manifest on each and every lateralized task, one method often used to classify individuals is the Chimeric Face Test (<a href="#c50">Levy, Heller, Banich, &amp; Burton, 1983b</a>). This test has a high test–retest and split-half reliability, has been validated on a sample ranging in age from 5 to the late 70s (<a href="#c48">Levine &amp; Levy, 1986</a>), and has been well normed on a sample of 111 right-handers and 111 left-handers (and more recently on a sample of over a thousand by<a href="#c31">Heller, 1996</a>). Furthermore, because this task requires only a preference judgment, it avoids issues of variations in level of performance across individuals. Finally, the Chimeric Face Test has been found to predict perceptual asymmetries on various tachistoscopic tasks (<a href="#c49">Levy et al., 1983a</a>; <a href="#c46">Levine et al., 1984</a>, <a href="#c47"> 1988</a>), levels of performance on nontachistoscopic tasks that are thought to engage processing of one hemisphere more than the other (e.g., verbal comprehension; <a href="#c4">Banich, Elledge, &amp; Stolar, 1992</a>), and asymmetric aspects of emotional processing (<a href="#c32">Heller, Etienne, &amp; Miller, 1995</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Both the degree and the direction of AHA might affect the efficiency of interhemispheric information processing. Individuals who exhibit a strong degree of AHA (regardless of its direction) may be less efficient at integrating or distributing information between the hemispheres, because they may have a tendency to let one hemisphere take over. In other words, the strength of AHA could constrain performance to a particular hemisphere and could create a load imbalance by constraining processing to one hemisphere.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The direction of AHA could also modulate the advantages of interhemispheric information processing by creating a load imbalance. If an individual's bias is to activate the same hemisphere that is recruited heavily by the critical operations of a particular task, the result will be a large load on a single hemisphere. Because processing is so heavily dependent on that hemisphere, the advantages afforded by interhemispheric processing may be decreased. For example, when a person performs a left-hemisphere task, an individual bias toward left-hemisphere activation should restrict or reduce interhemispheric interaction, yielding no performance advantage on across-hemisphere as opposed to within-hemisphere trials. On the other hand, when a person performs a right-hemisphere task, an individual bias toward left-hemisphere activation would facilitate a division of processing between the hemispheres to yield a greater across-hemisphere advantage. Accordingly, individuals with greater right-hemisphere activation should not benefit from interhemispheric interaction when performing the physical- and name-identity tasks that yield a right-hemisphere advantage, because both their individual AHA and the demands imposed by the task are biasing processing to the right hemisphere. In contrast, individuals with greater left-hemisphere activation should exhibit greater across-hemisphere advantages on the physical- and name-identity tasks, because their individual AHA complements the processing demands placed on the right hemisphere by the task. In this article, we examined the effects of the degree and direction of AHA on the relative size of the across-hemisphere advantage individuals display for the physical- and name-identity tasks, which yield right-hemisphere advantages, and for the rhyme task, which yields a left-hemisphere advantage.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Handedness</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Evidence from a variety of clinical and neuropsychological sources indicates that left-handers exhibit less functional lateralization than right-handers (e.g., <a href="#c14">Bryden, 1965</a>; <a href="#c27">Goodglass &amp; Quadfasel, 1954</a>; <a href="#c66">Rasmussen &amp; Milner, 1977</a>; <a href="#c68">Satz, 1980</a>). The greater functional equipotentiality of the hemispheres of left-handers provides for the possibility that patterns of interhemispheric interactions might vary between left- and right-handers. However, previous studies have not found any differences in interhemispheric interaction (e.g., <a href="#c5">Banich, Goering, Stolar, &amp; Belger, 1990</a>; <a href="#c63">Piccirilli, Finali, &amp; Sciarma, 1989</a>; <a href="#c7">Beaumont &amp; Dimond, 1973</a>, <a href="#c8"> 1975</a>; <a href="#c21">Dimond &amp; Beaumont, 1972a</a>), but they utilized less lateralized tasks than we used in this study. Hence, we examined whether handedness affects interhemispheric interaction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Therefore, the following three central issues were investigated in this study: (a) We investigated the effects of computational complexity on the degree of the across-hemisphere advantage by comparing performance on within- and across-hemisphere trials during tasks of varying complexity, namely a three-letter physical-identity task, a five-letter physical-identity task, a three-letter name-identity task, and a five-letter name-identity task. Accordingly, contrasting results for the three- versus five-item displays enabled us to examine the effects of increasing complexity at the perceptual level, comparison level, or both, whereas contrasting physical- and name-identity tasks enabled us to examine the effects of varying complexity at the decision level. (b) We investigated how interhemispheric interaction is affected by the degree of lateralization of a task by comparing performance on within- and across-hemisphere trials for the weakly lateralized physical- and name-identity tasks and the strongly left-hemisphere lateralized rhyme task. The rhyme task is as computationally complex as the weakly lateralized five-letter physical-identity task and the name-identity tasks, with regard to perceptual requirements, the nature of the decision process required, or both, but it differs in that it can only be performed by the left hemisphere. Hence, we predict that although the five-letter physical-identity task and the name-identity tasks will yield an across-hemisphere advantage, the rhyme task will not. (c) We investigated how individual differences in AHA and handedness affect the ability to distribute processing between the hemispheres during computationally complex tasks. To do so, we correlated the size of individuals' across-hemisphere advantages on our various interhemispheric tasks with their degree of AHA (as measured by the score on the Chimeric Face Test) and investigated how across-hemisphere processing is affected by handedness. We predicted that AHA limits the advantages of interhemispheric processing for individuals whose AHA is consistent with task demands. We also predicted that to the degree that left-handedness moderates the sole reliance on the left hemisphere for phonetic processing, we should observe an increase on across-hemisphere processing on this task relative to right-handers.</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_42" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Twenty-five right-handed (10 female and 15 male) and 28 left-handed (13 female and 15 male) individuals participated in this experiment.

These eccentricities should allow for initial receipt by each hemisphere, because most studies report little or no overlap in nasotemporal connections (e.g., <a href="#c30">Haun, 1978</a>) and any midline fusing mainly serves the purpose of stereopsis (e.g., <a href="#c29">Harvey, 1978</a>).

Within LVF = within field with the bottom item in the left visual field; within RVF = within field with the bottom item in the right visual field; across b-LVF = across field with the bottom item in the left visual field; across b-RVF = across field with the bottom item in the right visual field</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For all four tasks, half of the 224 trials consisted of match trials in which the bottom item matched one of the probe letters, and the other half were mismatch trials in which the bottom item did not match any of the probe letters. For half of the match trials (56 trials), the bottom item matched the letter that appeared in the same visual field, that is, on the same side of the fixation point. Henceforth, these will be referred to as <em>within-field trials.</em>
For the other half of the match trials (56 trials), the bottom item appeared contralateral to the letter it matched. Henceforth, these will be referred to as <em>across-field trials.</em>
For both within- and across-field trials, the bottom item appeared in the LVF for half the trials and in the RVF for the other half. Thus, there were four different match trial types: within field with the bottom item in the RVF (within RVF), within field with the bottom item in the LVF (within LVF), across field with the bottom item in the RVF (across b-RVF), and across field with the bottom item in the LVF (across b-LVF). Furthermore, the mismatch trials were designed such that for half of them the bottom item appeared in the RVF and for the other half it appeared in the LVF.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Rhyme task</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Whereas the four physical- and name-identity tasks can be performed by either hemisphere and hence are considered to be weakly lateralized, the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion required by the rhyme task can only be performed by the left hemisphere and hence is strongly lateralized. The stimuli presented during the rhyme task consisted of triangular arrays of letters with a digit at the center. The two top letters appeared 1.4° above and 2.8° lateral on either side of the center digit. The bottom three letters formed a word (e.g., SEA) and were displayed vertically 1.4° lateral to the right or left of the central fixation (refer to<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>
). The top letter of the word appeared 0.87° below fixation, the second was located 2.09° below fixation, and the third was located 3.3° below fixation. The letters spanned 0.78° horizontally and 1.17° vertically. Two blocks of 28 practice trials were followed by four blocks of 56 test trials. Each block was composed of half rhyme and half nonrhyming trials. Rhyme trials are those in which the vertically presented word rhymes with either one of the two letters (e.g., P and TEE, or J and DAY). The rhyming trials consisted equally of RVF and LVF trials and within- and across-hemisphere trials. The resulting trial types correspond to those used in the physical- and name-identity tasks. In the within-LVF trials, the bottom word appeared in the LVF and rhymed with the letter that appeared in the LVF above fixation; in the within-RVF trials, the word in the RVF rhymed with the letter in the RVF above fixation. For the across-b-LVF trials, the word presented in the LVF rhymed with the letter in the RVF. Finally, for the across-b-RVF trials, the word presented in the RVF rhymed with the letter in the LVF (see<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>
). All trials included a digit at the center whose report was used to ensure central fixation. Stimuli were carefully created such that the central digit did not rhyme with any of the letters or the word, and the top two letters were selected such that they would not rhyme with each other.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>AHA: The Chimeric Face Test</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Aside from the handedness test, a test of AHA, the Chimeric Face Test was also administered to each participant (<a href="#c50">Levy et al., 1983b</a>). This test consists of a 36-page booklet, with one test item per page. A test item consists of a pair of chimeric faces, one at the top of the page and one at the bottom. Each face is composed of a smiling half and a neutral half, and the two faces appearing on each page are mirror images of each other.</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were tested over five sessions. One of the five tachistoscopic tasks was administered in each session. Randomization of task presentation order was accomplished by counterbalancing the presentation order of the two groups of tasks (the verbal task and the nonverbal tasks) and then counterbalancing the order of presentation of the nonverbal tasks for each individual. Thus, half the individuals performed the verbal task (rhyme) first, and the other half performed the nonverbal tasks (physical and name identity) first. The presentation order of the nonverbal tasks was counterbalanced across participants. Ten task orders were generated, and participants were randomly assigned to one of these orders.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All participants were given the handedness questionnaire and the Chimeric Face Test in their first session, along with a vision test to ensure that they had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. By giving these tasks in the first session, we were able to discontinue testing of individuals who did not satisfy our criteria. Finally, participants were paid hourly for their participation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The procedures of administration for each task were as follows:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Physical-identity and name-identity tasks</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">During each session, an individual's head was stabilized on a chin rest, such that the eyes were located 32.9 cm from a graphics display screen. At the start of each trial, a central fixation point appeared on the screen. A single button mounted on a grip, aligned with the vertical midline of the screen, was located in front of the participant. Reaction time (RT) was the dependent measure. During the three-letter and five-letter physical-identity tasks, individuals were required to press the button if the bottom letter matched any of the top probe letters (which never matched) and to refrain from pressing the button if it did not (go/no-go RT). For the name-identity tasks, individuals had to press the button if the bottom item had the same name as any of the top probe items and to refrain from pressing the button if it did not (go/no-go RT). All displays were presented for 200 ms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a control over central fixation, participants were required to report the center digit for each trial, and if they could not do so, the trial was discarded. Stimulus duration was set at 200 ms to preclude lateral eye movements and to ensure that the information presented in each visual field was initially directed exclusively to the contralateral hemisphere. As an additional control over fixation, at the beginning of a test session, the edges of each individual's left and right blindspots were located, and a peripheral dot was placed 0.5° from each edge. Thus, if an individual's eyes deviated more than 0.5° from central fixation, the peripheral dots would be seen (<a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>). Any trial in which the individual reported seeing either of the peripheral dots was excluded from subsequent analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Within each session, participants were first given two blocks of 28 practice trials, followed by 224 test trials administered in four 56-trial blocks. Within each block, half of the trials were match and half were nonmatch. Participants responded with the left hand for two blocks and with the right hand for two blocks. The order of the response hand was counterbalanced across individuals. Data from trials were included in subsequent analyses only if (a) the correct button press was made, (b) the central item was reported correctly, and (c) the peripheral dots were not seen.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Rhyme task</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">During the rhyme test, participants were presented with two practice blocks of 28 trials, followed by four test blocks of 56 trials. The stimuli appeared for 200 ms. On each trial, participants were instructed to press a button if the vertically aligned word rhymed with either of the two top letters and to refrain from pressing the button if it did not (go/no-go RT). After making the rhyme decision, the participants were instructed to report the center fixation digit. For this task as well as the physical- and name-identity tasks, both RT and accuracy were recorded as dependent variables.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Chimeric Face Test</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For each pair of 36 faces in the Chimeric Face Test, participants were asked to decide which one looked happier, thus making a simple preference judgment. This test was scored by calculating the number of pairs in which a rightward attentional bias was shown (i.e., the face with the smile to the individual's right was judged happier) minus the number of pairs in which a leftward attentional bias was shown (i.e., the face with smile to the individual's left was judged happier), divided by the number of total pairs (36).</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_77" title="Results">Results</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The data analysis is presented in three sections, each of which addresses one of the central issues of this study. The first set of analyses examines how the manipulation of task complexity at different stages of information processing affects the pattern of performance on across-hemisphere trials. We present evidence that the advantages of distributing processing between the hemispheres increases with task complexity. The second set of analyses focuses on qualifications to this across-hemisphere advantage imposed by task laterality. We present evidence that although across-hemisphere trials yield superior performance during complex bihemispheric tasks, such an advantage does not accrue for a task that strongly relies on one hemisphere's processing capabilities. Finally, the last set of data analyses focuses on individual differences in AHA and provides evidence that AHA affects the degree to which interhemispheric interaction improves performance.</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0ECBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Effects of Manipulating Computational Complexity at Different Stages of Information Processing</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>RT analysis</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An initial analysis of variance (ANOVA) conducted on the mean RT data for the physical- and name-identity tasks with handedness as the grouping factor revealed no significant differences in the pattern of performance of right- and left-handers. Therefore, handedness was dropped as a between-subjects variable, and data from right- and left-handers were collapsed into one group.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A repeated-measures ANOVA, with the factors of decision type (physical identity, name identity), perceptual load (three items, five items), trial type (within right hemisphere [within RH], within left hemisphere [within LH], across right hemisphere [across RH], across left hemisphere [across LH]), and response hand (left, right), revealed two main effects that suggest that the manipulation of complexity was effective. First, a highly significant main effect of decision type, <em>F</em>(1, 52) = 201.4, <em>p</em>
&lt; .0001, indicated that the mean response time for the physical-identity decision (<em>M</em>
= 680 ms) was 120 ms faster than the mean for the name-identity decision (<em>M</em>
= 800 ms). Second, a main effect of perceptual load was also found, <em>F</em>(1, 52) = 182, <em>p</em>
&lt; .0001, revealing that responses were 128 ms faster to the three-item arrays (<em>M</em>
= 676 ms) as compared to the five-item arrays (<em>M</em>
= 804 ms). These two findings indicate that the name-identity decision is more demanding than the physical-identity decision and that the five-item tasks are more demanding than the three-item tasks. As expected, a main effect of trial type was also found, <em>F</em>(3, 52) = 32.6, <em>p</em>
&lt; .0001. Planned Scheffé contrasts indicated that across all tasks, RT on the across-hemisphere trials was 30 ms faster than on within-hemisphere trials, <em>F</em>(1, 52) = 30.8, <em>p</em>

Thus, it appears that increasing the perceptual load and increasing the complexity of the decision do not have additive effects. Rather, an increase in the perceptual load increases RT more for the less complex physical-identity task than for the more complex name-identity task.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, a significant Decision Type × Trial Type interaction was also obtained, <em>F</em>(3, 156) = 28.45, <em>p</em>

&lt; .0001. Taken together, these findings indicate that the name-identity decision benefits from the division of the information between the hemispheres to a greater degree than does the physical-identity decision, which required fewer computations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Both of these effects, however, were moderated by a highly significant three-way Decision Type × Perceptual Load × Trial Type interaction, <em>F</em>(3, 156) = 14.28, <em>p</em>
&lt; .0001. Planned Scheffé contrasts indicated that while individuals performed better on within-hemisphere trials on the three-item physical-identity task, <em>F</em>(1, 52) = 21.16, <em>p</em>
&lt; .001, their performance was superior on across-hemisphere trials on the five-item physical-identity task, <em>F</em>(1, 52) = 2.9, <em>p</em>

&lt; .01, in spite of the smaller perceptual load on the three-item task (see<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>

= .4991 (which we had anticipated because we expected the across-hemisphere advantage to be larger for five-item than three-item displays). We attribute this unforeseen finding to the unusually small size of the across-hemisphere advantage obtained on the five-item name-identity task in this experiment (5.7% of mean RT) as compared to our previous studies (10% of mean RT; <a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>; <a href="#c9">Belger &amp; Banich, 1992</a>). This faster response on the five-item name-identity trials was not associated with a speed–accuracy trade-off, hence we believe it may be attributable to a decision deadline phenomenon, such that participants responded without necessarily reaching a correct decision.

&lt; .001, indicating that distributing information between the hemispheres benefits performance to a greater extent when the complexity of a task is increased at the decision level rather than the perceptual level. Yet the effects are not additive, because the advantage afforded by across-hemisphere processing on the five-item name-identity task is no greater than that observed on the three-item name-identity task both in this study and in our prior one (<a href="#c9">Belger &amp; Banich, 1992</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Error rate analysis</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The effects found in the error analysis were, in general, compatible with the findings for mean RT.

&lt; .0001. Planned contrasts indicated that the higher accuracy on the name-identity task appears to be due to a significantly superior performance on the three-item name-identity task relative to the three-item physical-identity task, <em>F</em>(1, 52) = 107.29, <em>p</em>

The three-item name-identity task is computationally more complex than the three-item physical identity task, but in this case it is not more difficult, if difficulty is measured by accuracy level. Nonetheless, an across hemisphere advantage in RT was obtained for the three-item name-identity task, whereas the three-item physical-identity task yielded a within-hemisphere advantage. Furthermore, as will be discussed later, participants also demonstrated a significant across-hemisphere advantage in accuracy on the three-item name-identity task. Hence, the pattern of performance on the three-item name-identity task strongly supports our hypothesis that computational complexity rather than some general level of difficulty causes the across-hemisphere advantage to emerge.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As with the RT results, these main effects were modified by an interaction of Decision Type × Trial Type, <em>F</em>(3, 156) = 5, <em>p</em>

&lt; .001. Finally, the absence of a three-way Trial Type × Decision Type × Perceptual Load interaction indicated that the across-hemisphere advantage was comparably larger for the five-item as compared to the three-item displays for both the physical- and the name-identity tasks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Taken together, the results from the RT and error rate analyses reveal that at higher levels of computational complexity, dividing the processing between the hemispheres improves performance regardless of whether complexity is increased at the decision level or the perceptual level. Second, the results also indicate that increasing complexity at different stages of information processing does not act additively to influence the advantage afforded by across-hemisphere processing. Third, the RT data suggest that the across-hemisphere advantage appears to have an inherent ceiling effect. The relative size of the across-hemisphere advantage on the three-item arrays compared to the five-item arrays for the name-identity task (2.5% and 6.5%, respectively) was not significantly greater than the relative size of the across-hemisphere advantage on the three-item arrays compared to the five-item arrays for the physical-identity task.

We computed, for each individual, a measure of the size of the across-hemisphere advantage (the RT difference between the within- and the across-hemisphere trials relative to mean RT [(W − A)/Mean RT]). A simple regression analysis was conducted to determine if this score could be predicted by the score obtained on the Chimeric Face Test. For right-handers, this analysis revealed that the size of the across-hemisphere advantage on the rhyme task is closely linked to the AHA, as indicated by a highly significant correlation between the Chimeric Face Test score and the size of the across-hemisphere advantage on the rhyme task (<em>r</em>
= −.599, <em>p</em>
&lt; .005). The direction of the relationship indicates that a greater leftward bias on the face test, indicative of greater RH activation, is associated with a greater across-hemisphere advantage on the rhyme task. Because the leftward bias is associated with a relative right-hemisphere activation, we can infer that a greater right-hemisphere activation increases the efficiency of interhemispheric information processing for right-handers during the rhyme task. No relation was found between score on the Chimeric Face Test and the size of the across-hemisphere advantage for sinistrals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Handedness and perceptual asymmetry scores on within-hemisphere trials did not account for individual differences in the size of the across-hemisphere advantage on the rhyme task. Rather, for right-handers, AHA appears to account for 36% of the variance in the difference between within- and across-hemisphere response times on the rhyme task. Moreover, this factor (AHA) appears to play a different role for left- and right-handers, because it does not predict the size of the across-hemisphere advantage on the rhyme task for sinistrals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Physical- and name-identity tasks</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To determine whether the effects of AHA on the rhyme task were specific to that task or whether they represent reliable, general effects on interhemispheric processing, we also investigated the relationship of AHA and across-hemisphere processing on the physical- and name-identity tasks. Furthermore, examining these relationships allowed us to disentangle two possible reasons for the relationship between AHA and across-hemisphere processing observed in the rhyme task for right-handers. One possible explanation for this relationship is that relatively higher right-hemisphere activation counterbalances the left-hemisphere specialization of the rhyme task, leading to an increased across-hemisphere advantage. If so, a different pattern should be observed for the name- and physical-identity tasks, because they yield a right-hemisphere advantage. On the other hand, right-hemisphere activation might enhance interhemispheric processing regardless of the lateralization of the task to be performed, simply because the right hemisphere is dominant for distributing attention over space (<a href="#c56">Mesulam, 1981</a>). In this case, the relationship between AHA and the across-hemisphere advantage should be the same for the rhyme task as observed for the physical- and name-identity tasks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To investigate these questions, we entered data from right- and left-handers into two separate ANOVAs with the between-subjects factor of bias (RH, LH), and the within-subjects factors of task (three-item physical identity, five-item physical identity, three-item name identity, five-item name identity), trial type (within LVF, within RVF, across LVF, across RVF), and response hand. The criteria for assigning right- and left-handers to the right-hemisphere and left-hemisphere bias groups were the same as those used for the rhyme study, namely bias relative to the mean Chimeric Face Test scores in the<a href="#c50">Levy et al.

Thus, when hemispheric activation is opposite the load imposed by task demands, across-hemisphere processing is enhanced.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As with the analysis on the rhyme data, simple regressions were conducted on each of the four tasks to determine whether the size of the across-hemisphere advantage was correlated with the degree of AHA.

&lt; .005), with greater left-hemisphere activation associated with a greater across-hemisphere advantage. To increase the power of our analysis, we calculated a score for each individual representing the average size of the across-hemisphere (or within-hemisphere) advantage across the four right-hemisphere tasks and regressed that against AHA as measured by the Chimeric Face Test. This analysis revealed a significant correlation (<em>r</em>

Greater right-hemisphere activation facilitates across-hemisphere processing on verbal tasks, whereas greater left-hemisphere activation yields greater across-hemisphere advantages on right-hemisphere tasks. Thus, when an individual's hemispheric bias is in the opposite direction from task demands, such that task load can be dispersed between the hemispheres, processing is faster on across-hemisphere trials. To the degree that AHA and task demands load on the same hemisphere, the advantage afforded by dividing processing between the hemispheres is reduced.</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_135" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0EBACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Effects of Computational Complexity on Interhemispheric Interaction</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This study provides insights into both the extent to which interhemispheric interaction can aid task performance under computationally complex conditions and the constraints on such effects. One main issue addressed by this study was whether increasing computational complexity at the perceptual or comparison level would have similar effects on interhemispheric interaction as does increasing computational complexity at the decision level. Our results indicate that both these manipulations yield a performance advantage when the critical information is divided between the hemispheres. This effect is illustrated by the presence of an across-hemisphere advantage on the five-item physical-identity task but not on the three-item physical-identity task and by an across-hemisphere advantage on the three-item name-identity task that is lacking on the three-item physical task. Furthermore, increasing task demands at the decision level and at the perceptual level appear to have separable effects, which are not additive. Whereas the across-hemisphere advantage was approximately 5% of mean RT for the five-item physical-identity task, it was 10% of mean RT for the three-item name-identity task. Thus, the effect on interhemispheric interaction of increasing perceptual load appears to be less than that imposed by increasing complexity at the decision level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The absence of a greater across-hemisphere advantage on the five-item name-identity as compared to the three-item name-identity task indicates that the size of the between-hemisphere advantage does not increase constantly as a function of computational complexity but rather reaches a ceiling. The size of the across-hemisphere advantage in both the three- and five-item name-identity tasks (as well as our previous studies using these tasks : see Experiment 1d of<a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>; <a href="#c9">Belger &amp; Banich, 1992</a>) was approximately 10% of mean RT, which suggests that a point is reached where the across-hemisphere advantage can not be enlarged even if there is an accompanying increase in computational complexity. This ceiling effect has been observed in prior studies. For example, in Banich &amp;<a href="#c9">Belger (1990</a>, Experiment 3), we reported that the size of the across-hemisphere advantage was equivalent for the ordinal and summation tasks (8% and 10% of mean RT, respectively), even though mean RT was longer on the former than on the latter. Similar to the present study, we had previously reported that the three-letter name-identity task (<a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>) and the five-letter name-identity task (<a href="#c9">Belger &amp; Banich, 1992</a>) yield comparable across-hemisphere advantages (10% for each task) despite the longer RTs on the latter task. The ceiling effect may be a reflection of the capacity limits of each hemisphere. Dividing the processing load between the hemispheres may improve performance because task demands are increased until the total load reaches or surpasses the sum of the hemispheres' processing capabilities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is important to note that the results obtained in this study are consistent with a variety of other research in our laboratory, all of which indicate that the performance of computationally complex tasks is aided by interhemispheric interaction. Whereas we have consistently been unable to obtain an across-hemisphere advantage for simple physical-identity tasks, regardless of whether the stimuli were letters (<a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>, Experiment 1; <a href="#c9">Belger &amp; Banich, 1992</a>), digits (<a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>, Experiment 2), or shapes (<a href="#c6">Banich, Passarotti, &amp; Chambers, 1994</a>), we have obtained an across-hemisphere advantage when steps above and beyond perceptual processing and identification are required. For example, we have obtained an across-hemisphere advantage for a name-identity task (<a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>, Experiment 1), for tasks requiring judgments about the relative value of digits or their sum (<a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>, Experiment 2), for a task requiring individuals to determine whether two letters are identical to those of a target word (<a href="#c5">Banich et al., 1990</a>), and for a task in which individuals make a categorization judgment about shapes (<a href="#c6">Banich et al., 1994</a>). Furthermore, we have found such effects in the auditory and tactile modalities as well (<a href="#c62">Passarotti &amp; Banich, 1998</a>). Thus, repeatedly and consistently we have demonstrated that more computationally complex tasks yield an across-hemisphere advantage.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We should also note that we believe this effect to be a general phenomenon, because some recent studies from other laboratories have also demonstrated an across-hemisphere advantage under high-load conditions using methodologies different than ours. In one such study, <a href="#c61">Norman et al. (1992)</a>
showed that when presenting stimuli bilaterally, superior performance is found at higher levels of task difficulty when the load is divided between the hemispheres. Norman et al.'s stimuli consisted of dot patterns of two, four, or six dots. Individuals decided whether two-dot patterns simultaneously presented either in the same visual field or bilaterally to opposite visual fields were identical. Thus, to make a “same” decision, a simple template judgment was required. Their task-demand manipulation consisted of increasing the number of dots in the display. Consistent with our findings, they observed that for same decisions, an across-hemisphere advantage emerged at higher levels of task demand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A second main issue addressed by our study was the source of this across-hemisphere advantage. Based on our previous findings, we posited that the across-hemisphere advantage occurs because it allows for a division of processing between the hemispheres, lightening the load on each. We reasoned that if this were true, then if a computationally complex task relied exclusively on one hemisphere, an across-hemisphere advantage would not be obtained. To investigate this question, we tested right- and left-handed individuals on a rhyme decision task, which requires a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion relying strongly on the left hemisphere's processors (at least for right-handers) (<a href="#c67">Rayman &amp; Zaidel, 1991</a>), and tested these same individuals on equally complex tasks that did not rely exclusively on one hemisphere's processing capacity. The results indicate that despite the complexity of the computations required by the rhyme task, right-handers did not exhibit a performance benefit on across-hemisphere trials as they did for the other computationally complex tasks. Hence, these findings suggest that interhemispheric information processing improves performance to the extent that the computations required by a particular task can be supported or carried out by either hemisphere. It should be noted that there are very few tasks that rely exclusively on one hemisphere. For most tasks, both hemispheres are capable of performing them to some degree, albeit to differing degrees of competence and in different manners. Thus, we believe that for most computationally complex tasks (with phoneme-to-grapheme conversion and the control of speech output being notable exceptions), a division of processing across the hemispheres will aid task performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The third main issue investigated in this study was the degree to which individual differences moderate the advantages of across-hemisphere processing under computationally complex conditions. We investigated two different characteristics, AHA and handedness. The rationale for investigating these factors was that each might affect the ability to divide the processing load between the hemispheres.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our results indicate that handedness did not affect the ability to distribute the processing across the hemispheres for complex tasks. Left-handers showed an equally large across-hemisphere advantage on the five-letter physical-identity, the three-letter name-identity, and the five-letter name-identity tasks as right-handers. These findings were consistent with earlier ones (<a href="#c5">Banich et al., 1990</a>) in which no differences in interhemispheric processing were found between right- and left-handers on a spelling-to-target task. Further support for this position comes from the absence of a correlation between the left-hemisphere advantage on the rhyme task (as computed from the difference of within-RVF and within-LVF trials) and the size of the across-hemisphere advantage on this task. Such a finding suggests that lateralization alone does not predict how advantageous interhemispheric interaction is to task performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast to the lack of a difference in the size of the across-hemisphere advantage based on handedness, which we suggest should index static organizational differences between the hemispheres, AHA emerged as a highly reliable factor for predicting the advantages of dividing processing between the hemispheres, at least for right-handers. Our results indicate that when individuals performed right-hemisphere tasks (in our study, the name- and the physical-identity tasks), a bias toward left-hemisphere activation was associated with a greater across-hemisphere advantage, at least for speed of response. On the other hand, a bias toward right-hemisphere activation diminished the size of the across-hemisphere advantage for speed. The reverse pattern was found for the rhyme task, because a right-hemisphere bias increased the size of the across-hemisphere advantage, whereas a left-hemisphere bias reduced it. For both the rhyme and the name- and physical-identity tasks, the relationship between hemispheric activation bias and across-hemisphere advantage was a strong one, because a significant correlation was found in both cases.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This effect, however, was limited to right-handers, because no relation was found between AHA and the size of the across-hemisphere advantage on any of the tasks for left-handers. This dissimilarity indicates that there is a clear difference between right- and left-handers in the role of this factor and its relation to interhemispheric information processing. The present investigation does not permit us to pinpoint what might have caused the difference between right- and left-handers with regard to this factor. However, one could speculate that the consistent lateralization in right-handers permits us to capture the dynamic influence of AHA on interhemispheric interaction. In contrast, the variability of lateralization in left-handers in addition to the dynamic characteristic of AHA may make it more difficult to disentangle these effects. Note that this difference between the effect on AHA on interhemispheric interaction in left-handers and right-handers stands in contrast to the similarities of AHA on perceptual asymmetries (i.e., lateralized functioning) in these two handedness groups, which has been reported to account for 45.2% of the between-subjects variations in perceptual asymmetry scores (<a href="#c38">Kim et al., 1990</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The effects of AHA on the advantages afforded by interhemispheric processing is not altogether surprising. Although AHA is static for a given individual, its effects on behavior are dynamic because they are moderated by task demands (e.g., a right-hemisphere bias in AHA will increase right-hemisphere processing on a right-hemisphere task but will decrease left-hemisphere processing on a left-hemisphere task). Similarly, our findings suggest that interhemispheric information processing also appears to be dynamic, because its effect varies with task demands (i.e., decreasing performance for computationally simplex tasks but increasing performance for computationally complex ones). Hence, it is not surprising that the factor that most strongly predicts the relative benefits of interhemispheric information processing is also a measure of a dynamic aspect of hemispheric processing rather than a more static characteristic such as hemispheric specialization that is relatively consistent across individuals (e.g., the left hemisphere is specialized for speech in 95% of right-handers). The fact that the across-hemisphere advantage is maximized when AHA is discordant with task demands further supports the general principle that performance is enhanced when task load is distributed as equally as possible across the hemisphere.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This study and our previous results (<a href="#c2">Banich &amp; Belger, 1990</a>; <a href="#c9">Belger &amp; Banich, 1992</a>) suggest that the benefits of interhemispheric information processing are affected by task-related factors, such as complexity and task-specific computations, and by individual differences, such as characteristic individual differences in AHA. The conjoint consideration of these two factors appears to reliably predict the degree of across-hemisphere advantage observed in right-handers. Dividing the processing between the hemispheres during demanding tasks also appears to enhance performance for left-handers. However, no single individual difference factor appears to modulate and predict the size of the across-hemisphere advantage during complex tasks for left-handers. Sinistrals appear to constitute a very heterogeneous group, and hence further studies with larger samples should be conducted to decipher the effects of individual differences on interhemispheric information processing in left-handers.</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0EAACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A Dynamic Model of Interhemispheric Information Processing</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Based on the findings in this study, we propose a dynamic model of interhemispheric processing. Earlier, we had suggested a horse-race model of interhemispheric information processing (<a href="#c9">Belger &amp; Banich, 1992</a>), in which, after receipt of information, each hemisphere independently tries to complete processing as fast as possible. Here, we expand that conceptualization to include the effects of factors such as attentional bias and each hemisphere's competence for processing task-relevant information. We posit that increasing the activation level of the minor or the less specialized hemisphere for a particular task results in a greater involvement of that hemisphere in the task, which in turn diminishes the within-hemisphere advantage and enhances any advantages associated with a distribution of the processing load across the hemispheres. This distribution of the processing load across the hemispheres would enable parallel and faster processing of the load in a shorter time period. Hence, in some sense, interhemispheric interaction seems to play a regulatory role, by allowing the distribution of the computations across the hemispheres to yield more efficient information processing. Through this mechanism, interhemispheric interaction may also increase the amount of information that can be processed, thus increasing the overall processing capabilities of the brain. Conversely, the absence of a mechanism for distributing load would result in poor performance and decrements in overall attentional capabilities at higher levels of task complexity, as observed with split-brain patients (<a href="#c42">Kreuter et al., 1972</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This model conceptualizes interaction between the hemispheres as a dynamic process that serves to transfer information between the hemispheres and that has the emergent characteristic of being able to influence the processing capacity of the brain. In this dynamic model, each hemisphere is specialized to process information in a particular manner (which leads to hemispheric differences depending on the material to be processed), while at the same time possessing a baseline level of activation, which varies among individuals. Although the functional specialization of the processors shows great stability across right-handed individuals, the baseline activation level shows strong consistency within an individual across tasks but with great variability across individuals. Hence, during information processing, the load is distributed such that the specific requirements of the task to be performed and the asymmetry of an individual's hemispheric activation levels interact to create a unique balance point that would allow for optimum task performance with the lowest level resource allocation on both hemispheres. We speculate that this allocation of resources to particular hemispheres is not controlled centrally but is controlled automatically, such that most efficient processors are loaded and complete their operations first. Thus, we are not positing a model in which the callosum acts as a humunculus, overseeing the distribution of load. Rather, when the capacity of a given hemisphere is being taxed, we postulate that it serves to signal an opening of a callosal channel and the shunting of information to the other hemisphere. Because the efficiency of information processing in each hemisphere is a function of both its functional specialization and its activation level, the demands of a particular task and its characteristics will produce a unique pattern of resource allocation and distribution across the hemispheres.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This model interfaces well with what we know of attention and resource allocation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that although the human brain is a limited-capacity information processor, these resources are not free flowing but are task or processing specific (e.g., <a href="#c25">Friedman &amp; Polson, 1981</a>; <a href="#c26">Friedman, Polson, Dafoe, &amp; Gaskill, 1982</a>). By varying the nature and demands of a task (or a combination of tasks), one can increase processing efficiency without necessarily affecting overall processing capacity. For example, although performance of a verbal task will suffer during performance of a secondary verbal task, it will be relatively undegraded by simultaneous performance of a nonverbal spatial task specific (<a href="#c26">Friedman et al., 1982</a>). Thus, an increase in overall processing capacity can be obtained by simply modifying the demands of the tasks so that they rely on separate processors or by changing activation that would increase (or decrease) the role of different processors in task performance. Analogously, we posit that because both hemispheres can process most information, the brain has available, at the very least, two alternative cognitive strategies for most any task and two alternative processors. By dynamically redistributing the processing load on each hemisphere depending on task demands, one can increase the capacity of the brain. This flexibility is somewhat constrained by individual differences in AHA, which tend to consistently bias an individual to invoke the processing strategy of one hemisphere over the other. However, when such a bias is discordant with task demands, processing can be more efficient.</p><a id="neu-12-3-380-ID0E0JC0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_156" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Banich, M.
