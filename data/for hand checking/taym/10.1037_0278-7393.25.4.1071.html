Toppino</strong><br /><em>Department of Psychology, Villanova University</em>;<br /><strong>Mark A. Schneider</strong><br /><em>Department of Psychology, Loyola University of Chicago</em></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Acknowledgement: </strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The <em>spacing effect</em>   refers to the finding that
items with repetitions that are separated by time or other events
are remembered better than items with repetitions that are massed,  occurring in immediate succession. Many researchers would consider
this effect to be among the best established phenomena in the area
of learning and memory (e.g.,   <a href="#c4">Dempster,  1988</a>). Unfortunately,   theoretical agreement has been
harder to achieve.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although a variety of theoretical mechanisms have been proposed
to account for the spacing effect,   most accounts have been based on
some variation of either a deficient-processing or an
encoding-variability mechanism. According to deficient-processing
theories (e.g.,   <a href="#c2">Challis,  1993</a>; <a href="#c10">Jacoby,  1978</a>; <a href="#c14">Rose &amp; Rowe,  1976</a>; <a href="#c17">Shaughnessy,  Zimmerman,   &amp; Underwood,   1972</a>),   learners do not study
fully one presentation of a massed repetition (usually the second),  whereas they are more likely to study fully both presentations of a
spaced repetition. Proponents of these theories attribute the
superiority of spaced repetitions to greater total study time and/or
quality. According to encoding-variability theories (e.g.,   <a href="#c1">Bower,   1972</a>; <a href="#c5">Glenberg,   1976</a>,   <a href="#c6">
1979</a>; <a href="#c11">Madigan,  1969</a>),   massed repetitions are likely to be encoded
similarly,   whereas spaced repetitions are likely to be encoded
differently,   enabling a greater number of effective retrieval cues.
Thus,   proponents of these theories attribute the superiority of
spaced repetitions to the greater accessibility of differentially
encoded information.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The lack of a theoretical consensus does not reflect a lack of
empirical effort. The spacing-effect literature is voluminous.
Countless variables have been manipulated in the course of
investigating the spacing effect in a wide variety of memory tasks
(for early,   but still relevant,   reviews,   see <a href="#c3">Crowder,   1976</a>,   and <a href="#c9">Hintzman,   1974</a>). However,   the basic phenomenon
has been replicated repeatedly,   but the boundaries of the spacing
effect have proved to be exceedingly difficult to identify,   so no
existing theory can account for all of the relevant findings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Why should the spacing effect be so resistant to explanation?
Most likely,   the phenomenon is simply much more complex than it
appears on the surface,   and/or those of us who have worked on the
effect are simply too entrenched in our particular theoretical ruts
to see an alternative way of organizing and conceptualizing the
existing data. A much more worrisome scenario,   however,   is that the
existing data we seek to explain may be contaminated in some
way.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The latter possibility was raised by <a href="#c8">Hall (1992)</a>,   who concluded that intentional
free-recall studies in which spacing is manipulated as a mixed-list
(within-list) variable “are virtually useless in addressing
theoretical questions concerning spaced versus massed study” (p.
613). The reason,   Hall claimed,   is that such studies are inevitably
confounded by participants' displaced-rehearsal strategies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c8">Hall (1992)</a> proposed that
participants in a mixed-list experiment adopt a
differential-rehearsal strategy in which they stop processing a
massed repetition and devote the time to studying items presented
earlier in the list. He argued that this should benefit spaced
repetitions in particular because of the way in which lists are
often constructed. That is,   in mixed lists containing both massed
and spaced repetitions,   researchers usually equate the two types of
experimental items with respect to the serial positions of their
final occurrences in order to hold retention interval relatively
constant. As a result,   from any given point in the list,   there will
tend to be more preceding items from the spaced-repetition condition
than from the massed-repetition condition. Thus,   preceding
spaced-repetition items will be more likely than preceding
massed-repetition items to benefit from the extra study time
afforded to participants when they stop studying a current massed
repetition. In short,   to the extent that participants use Hall's
proposed differential-rehearsal strategy,   the spacing effect they
produce will be at least partially an artifact of list
structure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The potential severity of the problem this poses for the existing
data on spaced repetitions stems from the fact that the vast
majority of experiments on the spacing effect have employed a
mixed-list procedure. Furthermore,   although Hall focused his
discussion primarily on intentional free-recall experiments,   it
seems that displaced-rehearsal strategies could contaminate the
results of mixed-list spacing experiments involving other memory
tasks as well. Thus,   a significant proportion of the
spaced-repetition literature could be contaminated. Some apparent
spacing effects actually might be displaced-rehearsal effects,   and
some variables that seem to moderate the spacing effect actually
might influence rehearsal strategies. In the present article,   we
reexamine the empirical basis for <a href="#c8">Hall's (1992)</a> hypothesis to determine the
degree to which there may be cause for concern.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c8">Hall (1992)</a> argued that
the confounding inherent in mixed-list designs could be eliminated
by using unmixed lists containing only massed repetitions or only
spaced repetitions. Any displaced rehearsals would be devoted to
earlier items of the same type. He predicted that overall
performance on unmixed massed-repetition lists would not differ from
that on unmixed spaced-repetition lists.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The preexisting literature was of little help to <a href="#c8">Hall (1992)</a> in evaluating his
prediction. Only three previous articles had investigated the
spacing effect in free recall using unmixed lists,   and their results
were contradictory. <a href="#c20">Waugh
(1970)</a> found no overall spacing effect with unmixed lists,  whereas <a href="#c18">Underwood (1969</a>,  <a href="#c19">1970</a>) found strong
spacing effects. Although Underwood's findings were inconsistent
with Hall's displaced-rehearsal hypothesis,   Hall questioned the
generality of the findings. He noted that Underwood had used slow
presentation rates in conjunction with long lists. He suggested that
these conditions may have strained participants' ability to maintain
attention. They may have opted to rest,   rather than study,   during
massed repetitions,   thereby producing a spacing effect that would
not be obtained under more usual conditions. Although this account
of Underwood's findings was never evaluated empirically,   it provided
a justification for further investigation of the spacing effect in
the context of unmixed lists.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c8">Hall (1992)</a> conducted
three experiments in an attempt to test predictions derived from his
displaced-rehearsal hypothesis. In his first two experiments,   he did
not use pure unmixed lists consisting of only massed or only spaced
repetitions. Rather,   he used mixed lists containing one type of
repeated item (either massed or spaced repetitions) and
once-presented items. His results indicated no overall difference in
recall between massed- and spaced-repetition lists.
Spaced-repetition items were recalled better than massed-repetition
items,   but this difference was offset by superior recall of
once-presented items in massed-repetition lists in comparison with
spaced-repetition lists. Unfortunately,   interpretation of these
results was equivocal. Although the superiority of once-presented
items in the massed-repetition lists might have been due to
displaced rehearsal of once-presented items during the occurrence of
massed repetitions,   Hall acknowledged that the results could be
explained equally well by a list-strength effect (e.g.,   <a href="#c13">Ratcliff,   Clark,   &amp; Shiffrin,  1990</a>) in which stronger items inhibit retrieval of weaker
items. That is,   recall of once-presented items may have been
inhibited more by stronger spaced-repetition items than by weaker
massed-repetition items.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In his Experiment 3,   <a href="#c8">Hall
(1992)</a> compared free recall of lists in which all items
were massed repetitions with that of lists in which all items were
spaced repetitions. By using true unmixed lists that eliminated the
possibility of a list-strength effect,   Hall hoped to provide a
critical test of his displaced-rehearsal hypothesis. He predicted
that a different pattern of results would be obtained on the first
and second half of these lists. In the first half,   massed
repetitions should be recalled better than spaced repetitions
because only the former would benefit from displaced rehearsals
during the presentation of later massed repetitions. However,   in the
second half,   massed repetitions should be recalled more poorly than
spaced repetitions because participants would have devoted less
study time to the massed repetitions presented late in the list.
Hall expected the results in each half of the list to balance one
another so that no overall spacing effect would be obtained. His
results were in accordance with his predictions. Massed repetitions
were recalled better than spaced repetitions in the first half of
the lists,   whereas spaced repetitions were recalled better in the
second half. Consequently,   there was no overall spacing effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the results of <a href="#c8">Hall's
(1992)</a> Experiment 3 seem to support his
differential-rehearsal hypothesis,   there are reasons to question the
results and their implications. One concern is that Hall's
conclusions do not follow directly from his experimental design. It
is critical for Hall's interpretation of his data that performance
on the first half of his lists be caused by the type of item in the
second half of the lists. Thus,   Hall attributed better recall of
massed repetitions than spaced repetitions in the first half of a
list to the fact that only the former are followed by massed
repetitions. Unfortunately,   such a conclusion is complicated by the
fact that the relevant comparison is inherently confounded. Massed
items and spaced items in the first half of unmixed lists differ not
only in the type of item they precede,   but also in the type of item
that they themselves are.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Further concerns stem from the fact that <a href="#c8">Hall (1992)</a> did not include primacy and
recency buffers in his lists. It is standard procedure in the
spacing-effect literature to minimize serial-position effects by
excluding data for the first and last several items from analysis.
Researchers cannot tell the degree to which Hall's findings may be
unduly influenced by performance on early and/or late occurring
items. If displaced rehearsal is taking place as Hall hypothesized,  its effect may be limited to items that normally would occur in the
primacy buffer,   leaving data from the rest of the list relatively
unaffected. Also,   it is possible that serial position interacts with
the type of repeated item in a way that is particularly beneficial
to the recall of massed-repetition items. For example,   if the first
several items are massed repetitions,   they may be especially
distinctive and/or may receive more processing than typical massed
repetitions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We designed the present experiment to examine more closely the
bases for <a href="#c8">Hall's (1992)</a>
results. We replicated Hall's use of pure unmixed lists consisting
of only massed repetitions and only spaced repetitions,  respectively. However,   we also included lists containing both kinds
of items such that one type of item was presented in the first half
of the list (either massed or spaced) and the other type of item was
presented in the second half of the list (either spaced or massed).
Together,   our lists yielded a factorial design in which the type of
item in the first half of the list and the type of item in the
second half were manipulated independently. Thus,   it was possible to
determine whether performance on items in the first half of a list
was primarily the result of the type of item in that half or of the
type of item in the second half of the list. In addition,   we
analyzed data separately for each quarter of the list. Thus,   for
example,   it was possible to determine whether effects in the first
half of the list were primarily attributable to items in the first
quarter (comparable to the usual primacy buffer) or whether the
effects extended over the entire half of the list.</p><a id="xlm-25-4-1071-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_23" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="xlm-25-4-1071-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants and Design</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were 32 introductory psychology students at

experiment used a 2 × 2 within-subjects factorial design. In
the case of massed repetitions,   the second occurrence was presented
immediately after its first occurrence. The occurrences of spaced
repetitions were separated by spacings of three,   four,   five,   or six
intervening items.</p><a id="xlm-25-4-1071-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Materials</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We selected a pool of 96 common nouns from the norms of <a href="#c12">Paivio,   Yuille,   and Madigan (1968)</a>.

(at least 5.4 on a 7-point scale),   and a high Thorndike–Lorge
frequency (50 or more occurrences per 1 million words).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We then divided the pool into four sets of 24 items. We assigned

participants such that,   for a given participant,   the list serving in
each experimental condition involved a different set of 24 words and
that,   across participants,   each of the 16 lists for each condition
was presented equally often. In addition,   the order in which the
four experimental conditions was presented was counterbalanced
across participants. As a consequence of the counterbalancing,   each
word occurred equally often in each list quadrant for all
experimental conditions. This served to avoid confounds between
items (including item difficulty),   the type of repetition (massed

0.08,   and quadrant,   <em>F</em>(3,   93) = 7.51,  <em>MSE</em>   = 0.09. More important,   however,   there was a
significant Type of List × List Quadrant interaction,  <em>F</em>(3,   93) = 3.02,   <em>MSE</em>   = 0.10,  reflecting the fact that massed repetitions were recalled better in
Quadrant 1,   whereas the opposite was true in Quadrants 2,   3,   and 4.
This interaction constitutes a replication of the critical
interaction reported in <a href="#c8">Hall's
(1992)</a> Experiment 3. However,   with our more sensitive
design in which effects can be analyzed by list quadrant rather than
merely by list half,   it is clear that recall is better for massed-
as opposed to spaced-repetition items only in Quadrant 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When we temporarily put aside the question of what factor
accounts for the improved recall of early massed-repetition items in
our experiment and,   presumably,   in <a href="#c8">Hall's (1992)</a> study,   our findings suggest that
this unidentified factor is unlikely to have influenced the outcome
of many spaced-repetition experiments. The benefit for
massed-repetition items is limited to a region of the list that,   in
most experiments,   is occupied primarily by primacy buffers that
routinely are excluded from analysis. When we excluded data from the
first and last quadrants of the list (i.e.,   the first and last six
items,   respectively) as we normally would do with primacy- and
recency-buffer items,   a 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA (Type of
List × List Half,   involving only Quadrants 2 and 3) revealed a
main effect of spacing such that spaced repetitions were recalled
better than massed repetitions,   <em>F</em>(1,   31) = 4.65,  <em>MSE</em>   = 0.09. Quadrant 3 items were recalled better
than Quadrant 2 items,   but the effect did not reach conventional
levels of significance,   <em>F</em>(1,   31) = 3.96,  <em>MSE</em>   = 0.11. In addition,   there was no hint of an
interaction,   <em>F</em>   &lt; 1.00,   <em>MSE</em>   =
0.10. Thus,   when we followed the standard practice of excluding
primacy and recency buffers from analysis,   we obtained a clear
spacing effect that was unqualified by the recall advantage enjoyed
by early-occurring massed repetitions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast with our findings,   <a href="#c8">Hall
(1992)</a> predicted and obtained a null effect of spacing
using unmixed lists. He predicted that,   if learners were using his
hypothesized displaced-rehearsal strategy,   they would spend less
time processing a current massed-repetition item but would spend
that time rehearsing previously presented items of the same type so
that overall recall of massed repetitions would not suffer. The fact
that our results reveal a strong,   reliable overall spacing effect
with unmixed lists clearly indicates that Hall's null effect lacks
generality and raises serious questions about the viability of his
displaced-rehearsal hypothesis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A remaining question,   however,   is why <a href="#c8">Hall (1992</a>,   Experiment 3) obtained no overall
spacing effect whereas we did. It is not clear that this question
can be answered definitively. Part of the explanation may lie in the
fact that our lists were several items longer than Hall's lists.
Items falling in the primacy region of a shorter list would
constitute a greater proportion of the entire list and of the first
half in particular. Thus,   in one of Hall's lists,   the benefits
accruing to massed repetitions in the primacy region would carry
relatively greater weight in balancing the poorer recall of massed
repetitions in other parts of the list. However,   the different
results obtained in the two experiments also seem attributable to
the fact that spaced-repetition superiority in the second half of
the lists was greater in our study than in Hall's. Why this occurred
is unclear but is most likely attributable to one or more seemingly
minor differences in methodology. For example,   the lags separating
occurrences of spaced-repetition items ranged from two to six
intervening items in our experiment,   whereas Hall's lags ranged from
two to only four intervening items. Although this difference seems
unlikely to have had much effect,   it is at least possible that our
procedure constituted a stronger manipulation of the spacing
variable,   thereby contributing to the greater spaced-repetition
advantage in our experiment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To adequately address the issue of what underlies the improved
recall of early-occurring massed repetitions,   we had to combine the
data from our pure unmixed lists with data from our mixed lists in
which each half of a list consisted of a different type of item
(massed or spaced repetitions). A 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA with
repeated measures on all factors examined the recall of items in the
first half of the list as a function of the type of item in the
first half of the list (massed vs. spaced),   the type of item in the
second half of the list (massed vs. spaced),   and the quadrant of the

advantage of massed-repetition items in the first half of the list
was limited to Quadrant 1 and was attributable to an interaction
between quadrant and type of first-half item. Massed repetitions
apparently benefited more from being in the primacy region of the
list than did spaced repetitions. Why this occurred is unclear.
Possibly,   massed repetitions enjoy enhanced distinctiveness when
they are the first items presented,   or perhaps they benefit
differentially from participants' rehearsal patterns. The important
point here is that our results clearly indicate that their advantage
is related primarily to their own item type and not to the type of

mixed lists in which half of the items were spaced repetitions and
half were massed. This raises the question of whether a
list-strength effect in which stronger items are recalled at the
expense of weaker items could have influenced our results (<a href="#c13">Ratcliff et al.,   1990</a>; <a href="#c15">Rose &amp; Sutton,   1996</a>). This
prospect seems unlikely. Spaced repetitions were clearly
“stronger” in the second half of lists in the sense that they were
recalled better than second-half massed repetitions. However,   type
of second-half item did not significantly affect recall of items
from the first half of the list. Another way to address the issue is
to compare performance on the pure lists (massed–massed and
spaced–spaced) with performance on the same type of items from
mixed lists (e.g.,   recall of massed items from the first half of
massed–spaced lists averaged together with recall of massed
items from the second half of spaced–massed lists). To the
extent that there is a list-strength effect at work,   items from the
pure massed list should be recalled better than massed items in the
mixed lists,   and items from the pure spaced list should be recalled
worse than spaced items from the mixed lists. Our data,   however,  show that recall from pure and mixed lists was virtually identical.
The overall percentage of massed items recalled from the pure list
was 50.5%,   whereas the overall percentage of massed items
recalled from the mixed lists was 49.8%. The comparable
numbers for spaced repetitions were 57.2% for the pure list

effects were small and relatively inconsequential.</p><a id="xlm-25-4-1071-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_51" title="Conclusions">Conclusions</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We found no evidence for the displaced-rehearsal strategy that

learners generally use the displaced-rehearsal strategy proposed by <a href="#c8">Hall (1992)</a>. Furthermore,   we
obtained evidence indicating that the findings he interpreted to
support the displaced-rehearsal strategy were mainly attributable to
a primacy effect that differentially influences massed and spaced
repetitions. One practical implication of our results is that
primacy and recency buffers should be used in spaced-repetition
studies regardless of whether mixed or unmixed lists are used.
Beyond that,   our data provide some degree of reassurance about the
state of the existing data related to the spacing effect. These
findings obviously should not be interpreted to mean that Hall's
hypothesized displaced-rehearsal strategy is never used or that we
can be completely confident that the existing spaced-repetition data
are uncontaminated. Nevertheless,   our findings suggest that what
appeared to be solid evidence for Hall's hypothesized
displaced-rehearsal strategy was primarily the artifactual result of
a confounded experiment. Without evidence for a contaminating
factor,   there is little reason to question the validity of the data
obtained from mixed-list experiments,   and it seems appropriate for
researchers to continue to use the efficient mixed-list methodology.
There is,   however,   a warning implicit in <a href="#c8">Hall's (1992)</a> article that researchers would
be well-advised to heed. By relying almost exclusively on the
mixed-list methodology,   we run the risk of mistaking effects that
are specific to mixed-list conditions for effects that are generally
true of spacing repetitions. It would be wise to include
unmixed-list conditions more often in our experiments on the spacing
