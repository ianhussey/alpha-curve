Landgraf, 1995</a>; <a href="#c69">Schultz
&amp; Tapp, 1973</a>). It is also commonly admitted
that odor cues contribute to spatial orientation in rats (<a href="#c10">Buresova &amp; Bures, 1981</a>; <a href="#c32">Lavenex &amp; Schenk,
1996</a>). Vision plays a critical role in navigation in
rodents (<a href="#c27">Knierim, Kudrimoti,
&amp; McNaughton, 1998</a>; <a href="#c37">Maaswinkel &amp; Whishaw, 1999</a>), but the
relative importance of these two sensory modalities in various conditions is
not yet clearly understood.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We have designed experimental procedures aimed at comparing the contribution
of olfaction and vision in order to find out in which conditions these two sets
of sensory information may cooperate for place learning (<a href="#c56">Rossier &amp; Schenk, 2000</a>).
We hypothesized that the relative weight of vision and olfaction is linked with
the maturation of systems contributing to the processing of spatial
information. We have conducted a series of experiments to assess the
relative weight of olfactory and visual cues for <em>spatial

representation of space in which the goal and the position of the animal are

different age groups through the life span.</p><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0EFCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_11" title="Sensory Integration in Spatial Learning">Sensory Integration in Spatial Learning</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A large number of studies have been designed to analyze the specific
contribution of each sensory modality to spatial behavior (see <a href="#c22">Honzik, 1936a</a>, <a href="#c23">1936b</a>). In adult
rats, configuration of visual cues plays a major role in place learning
and retention (<a href="#c76">Suzuki,
Augerinos, &amp; Black, 1980</a>), whereas
olfaction seems to play a minor role (<a href="#c31">Lavenex &amp; Schenk, 1995</a>).
Moreover, kinesthesia is an important component for spatial
learning. This sense must cooperate with all the others because it
provides accurate information about self-motion (<a href="#c18">Etienne, 1992</a>; <a href="#c19">Etienne et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#c20">Etienne, Maurer, &amp;
Séguinot, 1996</a>; <a href="#c30">Lalonde, 1997</a>; <a href="#c79">Whishaw &amp; Gorny, 1999</a>; <a href="#c80">Whishaw &amp; Maaswinkel,
1998</a>). Tactile and auditory cue-based orientation
is seldom assessed, though rats can rely on auditory cues for place
learning in specific conditions (<a href="#c54">Rossier, Haeberli, &amp; Schenk,
2000</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Most studies of spatial memory focus on the use of visual cues.
Experimental procedures, such as the well-known water maze
(<a href="#c41">Morris, 1981</a>),
encourage the use of vision to discriminate the training position. The
distant landmarks are of greater importance, probably because they appear
more stable to a moving subject (<a href="#c16">Cressant, Muller, &amp; Poucet,
1999</a>; <a href="#c61">Save &amp; Poucet,
2000</a>). Nevertheless, proximal visual cues are also
used to solve spatial tasks when they are relevant (<a href="#c4">Brandner &amp; Schenk, 1998</a>; <a href="#c78">Vollmer-Conna &amp; Lemon,
1998</a>). Studies concerned with the processing and
computation of visual cues often consider olfactory cues as a source of
bias. Olfactory information is generally made irrelevant in spatial
tasks, and the importance of these cues is thus not frequently studied
per se.</p><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_16" title="Olfaction in Spatial Learning">Olfaction in Spatial Learning</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Reliance on olfactory cues is mainly assessed in discrimination tasks

(<a href="#c74">Staubli, Fraser,
Faraday, &amp; Lynch, 1987</a>) and are able to use it
to make route choices (<a href="#c75">Still &amp;

Uphold, 1971</a>). An experiment by <a href="#c10">Buresova and Bures (1981)</a>
revealed that allowing rats to have access to a large number of cues from
different modalities improved their performance in a radial maze, whereas
olfactory cues alone did not support efficient arm choice (<a href="#c44">Olton &amp; Collison, 1979</a>; <a href="#c45">Olton &amp; Samuelson,
1976</a>; <a href="#c82">Zoladek &amp;
Roberts, 1978</a>). <a href="#c33">Lavenex and Schenk (1997)</a> demonstrated the use
of proximal olfactory cues by rats for place discrimination and memory.
When the goal location was marked by a local olfactory cue, rats were
faster in learning the task and had a more precise memory of the goal
location, even after removal of this cue. Olfaction participates
in spatial behaviors, especially when the cues are directly associated
with specific places or when animals can rely on spatially distributed
olfactory traces (<a href="#c31">Lavenex &amp;
Schenk, 1995</a>, <a href="#c32">1996</a>, <a href="#c34">1998</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Rats are crepuscular, and we can assume that olfaction plays a role in
the dark. Indeed, <a href="#c32">Lavenex and
Schenk (1996)</a> showed that in total darkness, rats
performed very accurately in a radial maze with eight different odors marking
each tunnel roof. Moreover, following an interruption, they
were capable of selecting individual unvisited arms in spite of maze
reorganization. In an illuminated environment, however, rats
did not rely on olfactory information to perform the maze task, even when
vision did not provide relevant information, as in translucent
tunnels. They reacted to the rearrangement of the olfactory cues,
showing that they were aware of the presence of the cues and had memorized
their relative position. However, they did not use them
explicitly. These results suggested that light reduces the saliency of
olfactory cues for arm choice. The authors concluded that, in the
dark, rats are able to rely on a spatial representation based on
olfactory information and movement-derived cues. Moreover,
in this condition, arm choice was accurate despite maze
reorganization. This suggests that in the dark, arm selection can
be based on discrete olfactory cues. In illuminated environments,
olfactory information is integrated in a spatial representation only if it is
congruous with the otherwise available information. This suggests that a
hierarchy of sensory modalities contributes to spatial memory (<a href="#c26">Knierim, Kudrimoti, &amp; McNaughton,

requires a learning phase and includes the contribution of several sensory
processes (<a href="#c15">Cooper, Miya, &amp;
Mizumori, 1998</a>). The different sensory systems
might develop in discrete steps through ontogeny. Immature animals seem
first to be sensitive to tactile, olfactory, or gustatory stimuli
(<a href="#c1">Amiri, Dark, Noce, &amp;
Kirstein, 1998</a>; <a href="#c21">Gregory
&amp; Pfaff, 1971</a>; <a href="#c28">Koffman, Petrov, Varlinskaya, &amp;
Smotherman, 1998</a>; <a href="#c49">Polan
&amp; Hofer, 1999</a>; <a href="#c62">Schapiro
&amp; Salas, 1970</a>). In particular, the
olfactory system is already partially functional before birth, but
cellular proliferation continues until Day 30 postnatal (<a href="#c29">Kurcharski &amp; Hall, 1988</a>; <a href="#c35">Lopez-Mascaraque, De Carlos,
&amp; Valverde, 1996</a>; <a href="#c71">Singh, 1977</a>). The maturation of the
visual system occurs later. Even though their eyes are not fully open
until the age of about 15 days, immature rats start to move about at the
age of 12 days. At this age, they are able to home from a distance
of 20 centimeters (<a href="#c8">Bulut &amp; Altman,
1974</a>). Rats swim efficiently at Postnatal Day 16
(<a href="#c63">Schapiro, Salas, &amp;
Vukovich, 1970</a>), but they need to reach 32–35
days of age to accurately achieve a place navigation task in a water maze in
the absence of any intramaze cue (<a href="#c64">Schenk, 1985</a>). This has been
interpreted as a consequence of the slow maturation of the hippocampus until
the 2nd month of age (<a href="#c46">Pokorny &amp;
Yamamoto, 1981a</a>, <a href="#c47">1981b</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Before Postnatal Day 20, rat pups behave somewhat like adult rats with
a lesion of the hippocampus. Prior to the age of 25 days, rats do
not learn an alternation task in a T-maze (<a href="#c5">Bronstein, Dworkin, &amp; Bilder,
1974</a>). The development of behavioral capacities is
related to the growth of the central nervous system and to motor
development. For example, exploratory behaviors change during
development as animals become more active (<a href="#c11">Candland &amp; Campbell, 1962</a>). This
has been interpreted as a sign of sustained attention to the environment
(<a href="#c51">Renner, Bennett, &amp;
White, 1992</a>). Of course, young rats'
abilities depend on task conditions. Seventeen-day-old
rats were able to achieve a <em>beacon navigation</em> task (to
reach a cued place), whereas they failed in reaching the goal
location when it was not cued (<a href="#c59">Rudy,
Stadler-Morris, &amp; Albert, 1987</a>; <a href="#c65">Schenk, 1987</a>).
According to <a href="#c3">Brandeis, Brandys, and
Yehuda (1989)</a>, rats are able to perform a place
navigation task from about the age of 25 days. Thus, there is a
dissociation between these two types of navigation abilities during
ontogeny. Moreover, because there is no interocular equivalence
before Postnatal Day 28 in the rat, spatial memory requires a convergence
of the neural pathways originating from each eye onto common memory sites
(<a href="#c57">Rudy &amp; Paylor,
1987</a>; <a href="#c58">Rudy &amp;
Stadler-Morris, 1987</a>). Finally, not
only learning, but also long-term memory, is affected by
maturation. Indeed, long-term retention of a place is
impaired in 33-day-old rats compared with adults (<a href="#c6">Brown &amp; Kraemer, 1997</a>; <a href="#c73">Spreng, Rossier, &amp; Schenk,
2002</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Spatial memory relies on the integration of information from different
sensory modalities, and this implies processing at multiple levels
(<a href="#c54">Rossier, Haeberli &amp;
Schenk, 2000</a>; <a href="#c67">Schenk,
Grobéty, Lavenex, &amp; Lipp,
1995</a>). Spatial cognition in adult rats relies on several
components or brain modules (<a href="#c9">Bures et
al., 1997</a>; <a href="#c42">Morris, Schenk, Tweedie, &amp; Jarrard,
1990</a>), which may not mature simultaneously.
Comparing spatial navigation abilities at different ages in a controlled
environment might reveal the development of the processes underlying spatial
cognition. This should also indicate whether and how distant landmarks
from different sensory modalities are used at different stages. The aim
of the present study was to determine from which age rats are able to build a
spatial representation based on the integration of relational olfactory and
visual cues and at which age vision might become predominant. More
specifically, the question was whether there are some differences between
the use of olfactory and visual information in performing spatial
navigation. An important question was whether simultaneously available
visual and olfactory cues would be processed in an additive way or whether the
integration of both types of cues would lead to a more robust
representation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To answer these questions, we trained four age groups in three main
conditions. The first condition allowed rats to use a configuration of
three discrete visual light cues (<a href="#c53">Rossier, Grobéty, &amp; Schenk,
2000</a>). The second provided a configuration of five
olfactory cues that were dissociated from the five possible escape
positions. In the third condition, rats were trained with both
types of cues during the first 2 days. Further training was conducted
following removal of the olfactory or the visual cues. This allowed an
assessment of the impact of the olfactory cues on the use of the visual cues
both before and after the removal of the olfactory cues.</p><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_28" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0EECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Subjects</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One hundred thirty-six naive Long-Evans hooded rats (68

wooden nest box and various wooden pieces intended to encourage climbing and
movement through holes. This can be considered as a semi-enriched

(<a href="#c53">Rossier, Grobéty, &amp;
Schenk, 2000</a>; <a href="#c66">Schenk,
1989</a>). The platform was provided with five possible
escape holes, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure
1</a>. Each hole was covered with a disk of light plastic,
which was the same color as the platform and could easily be removed by the
rats. The detachable fittings of the holes were interchangeable and
washable. One hole only allowed passage to the subject's home cage
placed under the table. The fitting for the goal was connected to a
flexible tube and hidden by a light plastic disk. Dead-end holes
were blocked with a thick piece of foam rubber hidden under the plastic
disk. The empty home cage was placed under the table and connected to
the flexible tube, which was curved in order to minimize its
slope. The extremity of the tube (length 50 cm) was simply
deposited in the open cage. The home cage and the connected tube could
not be seen from the surface of the open field. Two infrared projectors
lit the homing board (Infralite IR-RS 4060,
narrow-band light emission, wavelength 880 nm; Institute of
Physiology, Lausanne, Switzerland). An infrared video
camera placed directly above the center of the table allowed recording of each

on a small platform to enter a covered hole connected to a tunnel until they
removed the cover and spontaneously entered the hole. Daily sessions on
the homing board consisted of five training trials. Pseudorandom
sequences of five different starting positions were used in each training
session. Individual rats remained on the table until they found the
escape hole, at a fixed spatial location throughout training, or
until 120 s had elapsed. Rats not able to locate the escape hole in the
allotted time were gently guided. During the initial trials of the first
session, the connected hole was only partially masked by the cover,
which the rats rapidly learned to push aside to reach the home cage. By
the end of the first session, the connected hole was completely
covered.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A drop of condensed milk was available in the home cage to maintain a stable
escape motivation. After the rat had reached the cage, it was
placed in a closed bucket for the 2-min intertrial interval. The
position of the bucket was varied from trial to trial so that it did not
represent a fixed spatial reference position. After each trial,
the escape hole and covering were replaced by clean ones. For conditions
with no olfactory cues, the table was rotated between trials in a
nonsystematic fashion. The intertrial rotation did not affect the
configuration between the cues and the escape location but made olfactory
traces inconsistent. For conditions with olfactory cues, all
plastic disks were replaced with clean ones between trials in order to control
the olfactory traces. Access to visual cues was controlled by conducting
all experiments in total darkness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Probe trials were conducted to assess the spatial bias toward the training
position in the different conditions. In these trials, the hole on
the training position was not connected to the home cage and,
therefore, was not different from the other holes. After 72
s, the hole on the training position was connected and the rat was
allowed access to its home cage. An additional reinforced trial was
given immediately following the probe trial, to avoid any extinction
effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All trials were videotaped and analyzed later. The latency to uncover
the escape hole (escape latency) was recorded. The distance
covered to reach the correct hole (escape distance) was calculated

Lausanne, Switzerland) analyzed all the probe trials (period of
72 s), and the time spent in each hole sector (20 cm

see three light cues. Each cue was identical and made of three light
emitting diodes. The cues were placed 50 cm from the table limit and at
the platform level. These cues were placed in three different positions
at the same distance and height of the table. The escape hole was
defined only by distant visuospatial cues; no relevant olfactory cues were
available (Rossier, Grobéty

distant olfactory cues made of scented Velcro tapes placed on the table
(blackberry, caramel, apricot, anise, and
tangerine). Each tape was placed in a closed bottle containing 2 ml
of an alimentary aroma during the hour preceding the test. Clean plastic
disks masked the olfactory traces left in the hole areas. In that
condition, no visual cue was available and the training hole was only
related to distant olfactory cues.</li><li> In the <i>V+O Cues then V Cues only</i> condition,

two additional conditions: <br /><ol type="1"><li>In the <i>Beacon Navigation</i> condition, rats could
benefit from a unique visual cue situated just behind the goal location,

Rats trained in the <em>Olfactory Cues</em> condition or in the <em>V+O Cues then V Cues only</em> condition were faster to escape
than those trained in the <em>Visual Cues</em> condition. A

two latter conditions were not different from each other. In
contrast, with the 24-day-old rats, the deletion of
the olfactory cues in the <em>V+O Cues then V Cues only</em>

12-month-old rats were more accurate with visual cues.
These differences are not likely to be detected in a rich landscape of complex
cues such as ordinary laboratory environments. In controlled
conditions, however, it was possible to exactly evaluate the
contribution of local or distributed olfactory and visual cues for place
navigation at different ages. The sensory preference changed through
development, and we observed a cooperation between vision and olfaction
to achieve a place navigation task in total darkness in
48-day-old and 3-month-old rats. For the
48-day-old rats, this cooperation was a prerequisite when
the target position was related to that of three discrete visual cues.
Thus, different sensory systems are involved at different ages in spatial
behavior and cognition. Olfaction is used first and appears to enable
the use of visual information. This maturation requires more than the
ability to detect cues in a given sensory modality. It affects the
capacity to integrate specific information for place learning and not for
simple guidance. We found different steps for the integration of
olfactory and visual information in a spatial representation.<br /><br /><a id="tbl2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/f4619e73cad7663b5a9677197f192908/571c8f2e/pdh/bne/bne-117-3-412-tbl2a.gif" alt="bne-117-3-412-tbl2a.gif" title="Summary of Results" /><em>Summary of Results</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In our experimental situation, we did not control the contribution of
kinesthesia, which must have been important, as the homing task was
presented on a solid ground (<a href="#c14">Cooper,
Manka, &amp; Mizumori, 2001</a>; <a href="#c20">Etienne et al.,
1996</a>; <a href="#c66">Schenk,
1989</a>). Kinesthesia is important to allow the integration
of visual information in a spatial representation (<a href="#c53">Rossier, Grobéty, &amp; Schenk,
2000</a>) and might also contribute to the integration of olfactory
information. Indeed, animals do not use only one type of
information, but they take advantage of a wide variety of sensory
information (<a href="#c54">Rossier, Haeberli,
&amp; Schenk, 2000</a>).</p><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0EEACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Early Preference for Distributed Olfactory Cues</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Twenty-four-day-old rats were particularly efficient in
using olfactory information to navigate in the dark. However, they
were slow to reach the escape hole and were unable to discriminate the correct
location when only three discrete visual cues were available. In
addition, the deletion of the olfactory cues in the <em>V+O Cues
then V Cues only</em> condition induced a dramatic decrease in
performance, confirming that rats of this age could not orient relative
to a set of three discrete light cues. Two 24-day-old
groups were trained in additional conditions to ensure that rats of that age
could perceive the visual cues and had enough time to learn the spatial
properties of the configuration of visual and olfactory cues. In the <em>Beacon Navigation</em> task, one cue was directly associated
with the escape hole. In this condition, the rats had to detect
the cue and to move toward it. They were particularly efficient in
achieving this simple task, suggesting that the poor performance with the
configuration of visual cues was not due to a problem of perception.
Another group of 24-day-old rats were given access to the
olfactory and visual cues during 5 days before removal of the distributed
olfactory cues (<em>Prolonged V+O Cues then V Cues only</em>
condition). These rats were unable to transfer the acquired ability
to the visual only condition in spite of prolonged training.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Taken together, these results suggest that a configuration of cues
distant from the target location can be processed and used by
24-day-old rats when the cues are olfactory, but not when
they are visual. Olfaction is sufficient to define places and to support
navigation in total darkness at an early age, when reliance on a
configuration of limited visual information seems impossible. The fact
that young animals were particularly accurate in distinguishing the olfactory
defined sector during probe trials confirms that they can perform better than
adults in some specific situations (<a href="#c72">Spear
&amp; Molina, 1987</a>). Olfaction is clearly the
sensory modality that allows early navigational abilities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Like younger rats, 48-day-old rats did not show a clear
discrimination of the goal sector with three visual cues. They were
faster in reaching the escape hole and did discriminate the training area
during probe trials when trained with the configuration of olfactory
cues. However, unlike 24-day-old rats, they
remained spatially oriented in spite of the removal of the olfactory cues
following training in the <em>V+O then V Cues only</em>
condition. They were able to transfer their ability to rapidly reach the
escape hole and to maintain a correct discrimination of the training area in
the visual-only condition. Thus, whereas the
48-day-old rats were not able to learn the position beginning
with visual cues only, the transitory presence of olfactory information
allowed for an efficient use of the set of visual cues. In
summary, rats of this age could rely on discrete visual cues for
orientation if allowed to calibrate them relative to olfactory cues during 2
days.</p><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0EDACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Late Development of Orientation Abilities With the Minimal Visual Configuration</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As expected, adult rats were able to achieve the homing task based on
unimodal visual or olfactory cues (<a href="#c16">Cressant
et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#c32">Lavenex &amp; Schenk, 1996</a>, <a href="#c33">1997</a>). It is noteworthy
that adult rats were able to show a significant discrimination in the difficult
condition with only three identical visual cues. This is a minimal cue
condition that forces animals to use a spatial navigation strategy
(<a href="#c53">Rossier, Grobéty, &amp;
Schenk, 2000</a>). Spatial abilities based on visual
information seem to develop throughout early adulthood. In the two
conditions in which the rats could rely on both types of cues during 2
days, they were quicker, made more direct paths to reach the
correct hole, and spent more time in the correct area. They were
therefore more accurate in achieving the task in the presence of both types of
cues and remained accurate after removal of either type of cue. Both
olfactory and visual cues appeared to potentiate the use of the other
modality. Females seemed a little more accurate in discriminating the
correct location during the two first probe trials with olfactory cues
only.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Twelve-month-old rats were better in achieving the task with
visual rather than olfactory cues. The group with visual cues was faster
in reaching the escape hole and discriminated the correct location from the
first probe trial. The rats with olfactory cues were slower in reaching
the target hole during the training trials and expressed little discrimination
of the correct location during the two first probe trials. During the
third probe trial, however, they showed a significant bias toward
the olfactory defined location. Thus, 12-month-old
rats were good at performing the task with visual cues, but they needed
more time when given only olfactory cues. Like the younger adult
rats, they were faster when provided with combined cues. This was
particularly evident in females, which seemed better in taking advantage
of olfactory information at that age. Deletion of the olfactory cues had
no differential effect in males and females. Thus, as they
age, rats appear less prone to rely on olfactory information in an
orientation task, though they still benefit from their combination with
visual cues.</p><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0ECACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Sensory Specialization or Difficulty Due to Minimal Cue Condition?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Young subjects are good in perceiving olfactory cues (<a href="#c48">Polan &amp; Hofer, 1998</a>; <a href="#c81">Wilson &amp; Sullivan,
1994</a>). In our task, they were able to use them for
spatial navigation. In contrast, they were not able to use
discrete visual cues to achieve the task when these were not directly
associated with the target (<a href="#c60">Salazar,
Rossier, &amp; Schenk, 2000</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, the difficulty in relying on the visual cues appears to
contradict the results of <a href="#c7">Brown and Whishaw
(2000)</a>. These authors proposed that place and cue
navigation develop simultaneously, at a very early age. They
suggested that both 19- and 20-day-old rats learned the
place and the cued tasks equally well. However, their results
indicate that in spite of a significant discrimination of the target during the
probe trial, the rats in the place navigation task were much slower in
escape than those in the cued task (15–20 s vs. approximately
8 s). Accurate navigation should allow for much lower latencies
than were found by <a href="#c7">Brown and Whishaw
(2000)</a>. The problem of the place navigation task is
that one usually does not know which strategies are used for reaching the
target and for expressing place preference. When the environment
provides a rich complex of visual cues, it is difficult to know which of
these cues are used to achieve the task and how they are processed. In
particular, the spatial abilities of very young subjects depend on the
experimental situation, and they can rely on visual cues, as shown
by <a href="#c12">Carman and Mactutus
(2001)</a>. The discrepancies in the literature
concerning the ontogeny of spatial navigation (<a href="#c7">Brown &amp; Whishaw, 2000</a>; <a href="#c12">Carman &amp; Mactutus,
2001</a>; <a href="#c59">Rudy et al.,
1987</a>; <a href="#c64">Schenk,
1985</a>) suggest that it is only possible to compare immature
rats' performances with that of adults in controlled
conditions.</p><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0EBACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A Maturation in Two Steps?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We consider that the olfactory cues placed on the table were
“relational” because none of them was directly associated with the
escape hole. The availability of olfactory cues around the holes was
controlled by changing the plastic disks before each trial (see the Method
section). Consequently, rats aged 24 days were able to learn
the relation among the olfactory cues in order to navigate. These cues
were distributed over the whole table and might have formed complex gradients
more likely to guide young subjects. In comparison, there were
only three visual cues, and the rats had to remember the escape position
relative to the geometrical configuration of cues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Thus, the deficit in processing discrete visual information does not
imply that immature animals are not able to rely on vision for spatial
orientation. It is really related to experimental conditions. The
fact that rats were able to process and use relational or dissociated olfactory
information suggests that in our visual condition, the difficulty of the
visual cue task was due to the effort of processing the particular feature
provided by the relative position of three identical cues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Thus, in contrast with the processing of distributed olfactory
cues, orientation based on the three visual cues might require a sketch
map constructed from an arrangement of positional cues, as in a
topographic map. This processing relies on a phylogenetically more
recent development of the hippocampal formation (<a href="#c24">Jacobs &amp; Schenk, in press</a>). We
suggest that the youngest rats relied on their relatively mature bearing map
based on the integration of salient distributed cues, such as odor
gradients emanating from the scented strips in the present work or rich visual
cues such as in <a href="#c12">Carman and Mactutus
(2001)</a>. As the sketch map matured, the rats
began to rely preferentially on discrete distant visual cues. Our
results also suggest that the sketch map is progressively calibrated by the
bearing map during the 2nd postnatal month and may not become autonomous until
the 3rd month, coinciding with the ontogeny of hippocampal metabolism
(<a href="#c40">Meibach, Ross, Cox,
&amp; Glick, 1980</a>). This hypothesis is also in
agreement with recent findings from <a href="#c38">Martin and
Berthoz (2002)</a> that the locational firing of hippocampal
place cells is less specific and stable in rats under the age of 50
days.</p><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0EAACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A Supramodal Representation</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The importance of the olfactory information for young animals in total
darkness confirms the results of <a href="#c32">Lavenex and
Schenk (1996)</a>, and the electrophysiological data
showing that place cells encode olfactory information in light (<a href="#c70">Shapiro, Tanila, &amp; Eichenbaum,
1997</a>) and particularly in total darkness (<a href="#c50">Poucet, Save, &amp;
Lenck-Santini, 2000</a>). Thus, olfactory
information contributes to the elaboration of spatial representation. In
fact, a hierarchy of sensory modalities participates in spatial memory
(<a href="#c15">Cooper et al.,
1998</a>). But this hierarchy changes through
development. Olfaction may participate in the calibration of the spatial
information processing and may therefore enable the integration of visual
information. Olfaction not only allows <em>beacon
navigation</em> but also supports <em>place</em> or <em>spatial
navigation</em> that relies on the processing of configurational
information such as our set of olfactory cues. Vision,
however, provides accurate information from the changing visual landscape
during locomotion and might contribute to the learning of nearby visual
configurations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To conclude, it is clear that spatial cognition does involve several
components and relies on different sensory modalities. These modalities
do not develop simultaneously, and each modality makes a specific
contribution to spatial cognition. Young rats are good at using
olfaction but are less efficient in using vision, whereas older rats are
good at using vision, but not very accurate in using olfaction. We
observed an interesting interaction between sensory modalities, which was
reciprocal in adults. Olfaction enables the use of visual information in
48-day-old rats. Animals can rely simultaneously on
information from different sensory modalities, which indicates that the
spatial representation is supramodal, as suggested by <a href="#c77">Swanson (1983)</a>. It is
thus important to study how this hierarchy changes during aging.</p><a id="bne-117-3-412-ID0E0SC0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_112" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Amiri, L., Dark, T., Noce, K.
