Heise.<br /><br />Partial descriptions of this work were presented at the meeting of the American Psychological Association, Washington, D.C., August 1982 (<a href="#c38">Pontecorvo   &amp;   Heise, 1982</a>) and the meeting of the Society for Neuroscience Los Angeles, October 1981 (<a href="#c44">Spencer, 1981</a>).<br /><br />Order of the first two authors was decided by coin toss.<br /><br />We thank Jeffrey Hudson for technical assistance and Eleanor Cordisco for secretarial assistance.<br /><br />M.

However, more recent studies of the effects of antimuscarinics on discrimination performance in rats (<a href="#c30">Milar, 1981</a>; <a href="#c31">Milar, Halgren, &amp; Heise, 1978</a>) and on acquisition and maintenance of classical conditions in rabbits (<a href="#c10">Downs et al., 1972</a>; <a href="#c32">Moore, Goodell, &amp; Solomon, 1976</a>) have demonstrated that anticholinergic effects are not specific for inhibited responses. In these experiments, atropine and scopolamine symmetrically increased the frequency of nonreinforced responding and decreased the frequency of reinforced responding. These latter results are more consistent with a cholinergic involvement in sensory or decisional processes (e.g., <a href="#c19">Heise, 1975</a>; <a href="#c50">Warburton, 1977</a>) than with an involvement in response suppression.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Numerous studies have also found that anticholinergics produce deficits in short-term or working memory tasks. The term <em>working memory</em> is used here in a manner similar to that used by <a href="#c33">Olton and Samuelson (1976</a>; see also <a href="#c23">Honig, 1978)</a>: Working memory is stimulus control exerted on behavior by a unique event (or relation among events) no longer present at the time of response. This empirical definition of memory therefore applies not only to selection of arms in the eight-arm radial maze (where it was conceived) but also the trial-oriented memory measured in such discrete-trial procedures as spatial alternation of lever pressing. Unfortunately, many pharmacological studies of working memory (e.g., <a href="#c1">Alpern &amp; Jackson, 1978</a>; <a href="#c46">Stevens, 1981</a>) did not determine the drug effects over a range of retention interval durations. Therefore, these studies do not distinguish between drug-induced changes in time-dependent memory processes and changes in presumably time-independent processes such as attention or response selection (<a href="#c19">Heise, 1975</a>; <a href="#c52">Weiskrantz, 1968</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In those studies in which memory performance at several retention intervals has been examined, it was generally reported that cholinolytics did not affect the time course of retention (rats on delayed response: <a href="#c2">Alpern &amp; Marriott, 1973</a>; <a href="#c20">Heise, Conner, &amp; Martin, 1976</a>; <a href="#c27">Ksir, 1974</a>; monkeys on delayed matching to sample: <a href="#c4">Bohdanecky, Jarvik, &amp; Carley, 1967</a>; <a href="#c40">Roberts &amp; Bradley, 1967</a>; <a href="#c41">Robustelli, Glick, Goldfarb, Geller &amp; Jarvick, 1969</a>; pigeons on delayed matching to sample: <a href="#c47">Teal &amp; Evans, in press</a>). In those studies, atropine and scopolamine reduced response accuracy equally at all retention intervals and thus did not affect the rate of decline in accuracy over time. <a href="#c45">Spencer and Lal (1983)</a> reviewed those as well as other studies of antimuscarinic effects and concluded that although scopolamine probably interferes with encoding and retrieval processes in memory, little evidence existed for drug effects on memory storage (retention).

Rats were trained to perform a new working memory task, the continuous nonmatching to sample (CNM) task (<a href="#c36">Pontecorvo, 1983</a>). The CNM task is a variant of the go-no-go matching to sample task introduced by <a href="#c26">Konorski (1959</a>; see also <a href="#c40">Roberts &amp; Bradley, 1967</a>; <a href="#c42">Sahgal &amp; Iversen, 1978</a>; <a href="#c49">Wallace, Steinert, Scobie, &amp; Spear, 1980)</a>. In this schedule, a variable number of trials with one of two possible stimuli (bright and dim panel lights) alternated with a variable number of trials with the other stimulus (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The first response was reinforced during trials in which the stimulus was different (“nonmatch” trials) from that on the previous trial. Lever presses on match trials were never reinforced. Thus, on each trial, the subject had to “remember” the previous trial's stimulus in order to determine whether a response on the present trial would be reinforced. Retention could therefore be inferred from the function relating trial response accuracy to the intervals preceding trials.<br /><br /><a id="fig1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/c7110e83e0c148b3943f7b2c714c30cf/571c949f/pdh/bne/bne-99-6-1049-fig1a.gif" alt="bne-99-6-1049-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

The results were evaluated in terms of the theory of signal detection (TSD: <a href="#c16">Green &amp; Swets, 1966</a>). TSD assumes that performance in a yes/no (go-no-go) discrimination or memory task depends on two independent factors: the subject's ability to detect or remember the appropriate stimulus for a response (response accuracy, sensitivity) and the subject's relative preference for responding or not responding (bias). If scopolamine affects behavioral inhibition (as proposed by <a href="#c7">Carlton, 1963</a>), then it should increase the overall tendency to respond and thus increase bias. Alternatively, if scopolamine disrupts the expression of working memory (e.g., <a href="#c3">Bartus &amp; Johnson, 1976</a>) or interferes with discrimination processes (e.g., <a href="#c19">Heise, 1975</a>), it should reduce the accuracy of responding (sensitivity) but have little or no effect on bias.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This interpretation was empirically validated by comparing the effects of scopolamine on CNM performance with those of low doses of <em>d</em>-amphetamine (Experiments 1 and 2) and with the effects of procedural manipulations of stimulus discriminability in the CNM task (Experiment 4). The specificity of scopolamine's effect on working memory was also assessed by comparing the effects of scopolamine in the CNM task with those obtained in a discrimination task not explicitly requiring mediation by working memory (Experiment 3). Because the task parameters and baseline levels of performance were similar in the memory and discrimination tasks, differences in scopolamine's effects could be attributed to the different memory requirements in the two tasks.</p><a id="bne-99-6-1049-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_15" title="Experiment 1">Experiment 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Experiment 1, we contrasted the effects of the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine and the catecholaminergic agonist <em>d</em>-amphetamine on the performance of rats in the CNM task.</p><a id="bne-99-6-1049-ID0ECECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Subjects</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Sixteen naive 90-day-old male Sprague Dawley rats, obtained from Harlan Industries, Inc.

Two frosted glass levers were mounted on the front panel of each chamber, 8.0 cm above the floor and 13.5 cm apart. The left lever was covered by a metal cap and was not accessible to the subjects. A weight of 25–35 g was required to depress the right lever and register a response. A water dispenser, centered on the front panel 3.25 cm above the floor and between the two levers, was used to deliver a 0.05-ml drop of water. Three translucent lenses were centered on the front panel 4.5 cm apart and 14 cm above the floor. The discriminative stimuli for Experiment 1 were produced by illuminating the center lens with either a bright or a dim light. The ratio of the intensity of the dim stimulus relative to the bright stimulus (dim/bright) was approximately .04. No other illumination was present during the experimental session.

The fact that scopolamine and amphetamine differently affected performance further suggests that the effects of these drugs were due to their specific neurochemical actions and not to the effects of the injection procedure or drug exposure per se. Scopolamine reduced response accuracy at all retention intervals but did not affect the time course of retention. The reduction in response accuracy was accompanied by a decrease in the overall tendency to respond. Thus, there was no evidence for a “disinhibitory” effect of the drug. If anything, response inhibition increased under scopolamine. The decrease in bias produced by scopolamine may be an indirect result of the low levels of sensitivity produced by the drug. A number of previous studies (<a href="#c43">Schusterman &amp; Johnson, 1975</a>; <a href="#c48">Terman &amp; Terman, 1972</a>) have demonstrated changes in bias at extreme levels of sensitivity for tasks in which sensitivity and bias were otherwise independent. Possible interactions between sensitivity and bias in the CNM task were further examined in Experiment 4.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although scopolamine decreased bias on initial trials, it also increased the probability of responding on correction trials [<em>P</em>(C)]. These findings are not contradictory. Initial trials consisted of both no-go (match) and go (nonmatch) trials. Scopolamine increased responding on initial no-go trials and decreased responding on initial go trials. Correction trials, in contrast, were always match trials, and so the only effect observed was an increase in responding. Thus, scopolamine produced a qualitatively similar increase in go errors on both initial and correction match trials. However, it should be noted that the magnitude of the effect was greater on correction trials, as was the absolute probability of an error. This may indicate some selective increase in perseverative responding (the tendency to repeat a response; e.g., <a href="#c12">Drew, Miller, &amp; Baugh, 1973</a>; <a href="#c25">Khavari &amp; Maickel, 1967</a>) independent of the initial response bias level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The absence of an interaction between response accuracy and retention interval duration suggests that scopolamine did not disrupt retention. However, it should be noted that under drug conditions, response accuracy approached chance (<em>A</em>′ = .50) at the longer retention intervals. Thus, a possible effect of scopolamine on retention might have been masked by a floor effect at longer retention intervals. Experiment 2 was designed to eliminate this problem.</p><a id="bne-99-6-1049-ID0EDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_47" title="Experiment 2">Experiment 2</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Experiment 2 differed from Experiment 1 in that the retention intervals in Experiment 2 varied equally within each session among the three possible values (2.5, 5, or 10 s).

In both experiments, scopolamine reduced sensitivity and bias but did not interact with retention interval duration. Because performance at the longer retention intervals in Experiment 2 was relatively accurate, it is unlikely that a drug effect on retention was obscured by floor effects. Nevertheless, scopolamine again reduced accuracy but did not alter the time course of retention. Thus, the results of Experiment 2 support the hypothesis that scopolamine does not alter response output/inhibition or retention in working memory.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, the results of Experiments 1 and 2 do not rule out the possibility of a cholinergic role in memory processing. The cholinergic system may be involved in some aspect of processing that does not affect retention but is uniquely required in a memory task (e.g., encoding or retrieval in working memory). This hypothesis could be tested by comparing drug effects in a working memory task with those in a discrimination task that is comparable with regard to level of stimulus control (baseline accuracy), temporal parameters, and programmed reinforcement density. Experiment 3 provided this test.</p><a id="bne-99-6-1049-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_73" title="Experiment 3">Experiment 3</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Experiment 3, we contrasted the effects of scopolamine on performance in the CNM task with its effects on a go-no-go intensity discrimination task in which there was no explicit working memory requirement. Two variations of this discrimination task were employed. For one group of rats, the discriminative stimuli were similar to those used in Experiments 1 and 2 (large difference condition, LD). However, the resulting levels of response accuracy were considerably higher than obtained in the CNM task. Therefore, for a second group of rats (small difference condition, SD), the difference between bright and dim stimuli was adjusted so that the level of response accuracy was approximately the same as that in the CNM task. For both groups of rats, the sequence of trial stimuli and intertrial intervals were arranged so that reinforcers were available at the same points in the session as in Experiment 2. Thus, the effects of scopolamine in the two discrimination tasks could be directly compared with the effects obtained in the CNM memory task (Experiment 2).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Three possible outcomes of Experiment 3 would be of particular interest. If scopolamine interferes exclusively with working memory, then it should disrupt performance more in the CNM task than in the SD or LD discrimination task. If scopolamine's effects depend solely on the discriminability of the stimuli, then the drug's effects on LD and CNM performance should be equal, and performance on both of these tasks should be less affected than on the SD task. Finally, if scopolamine's effects vary solely with baseline performance (i.e., with level of “stimulus control”), then equivalent drug effects should be observed in the SD and CNM tasks, with lesser effects obtained in the LD discrimination task.</p><a id="bne-99-6-1049-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Subjects</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Ten naive male Sprague-Dawley rats served as subjects for Experiment 3.

The first lever press on a trial in which the positive stimulus was presented (a go trial) terminated the trial and produced water reinforcement. Lever presses in the presence of the negative stimulus did not terminate the trial, were not reinforced, and caused the no-go trial to be repeated (correction trials). Failure to respond on either a go trial or a no-go trial had no scheduled consequence. The sequence of trials was arranged such that reinforcements were possible at the same point in the session as in the corresponding CNM procedure (i.e., go trials in the discrimination task were scheduled to appear at the same points in the session as nonmatch trials in the CNM task). Thus, there were on average 3.6 no-go trials for each go trial. There were 458 total trials in the SD condition and 229 total trials in the LD condition. The maximum trial duration was 5 s. The intertrial intervals (ITIs) in the discrimination tasks were not retention intervals; they served only to separate the trials. The durations of the ITIs were gradually increased as in Experiment 2.

The fact that scopolamine decreased sensitivity more in the CNM task than in the LD discrimination task is consistent with the hypothesis that scopolamine disrupts working memory. The fact that scopolamine disrupted performance of the SD task more than performance of the LD task is consistent with the hypothesis that scopolamine disrupts sensory discrimination processes. Although it is possible that scopolamine disrupted both memory and sensory processes in these experiments, the finding that scopolamine affected performance in the memory and discrimination tasks equally when the baseline levels of performance accuracy were equated (CNM vs. SD) suggests another interpretation: Scopolamine may have disrupted some process common to both types of tasks that covaries with baseline levels of accuracy, for example, scopolamine might interfere with decision processes involving the retrieval of stimulus-response rules from reference memory. Thus, access to general rules guiding behavior in various situations (signaled by discriminative stimuli) may be selectively perturbed by the drug. Furthermore, both increasing the memory requirement and decreasing the discriminability of the stimuli might increase the difficulty of the retrieval process and thus render performance on the CNM and SD tasks more sensitive than that on the LD task to disruption by scopolamine.</p><a id="bne-99-6-1049-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_99" title="Experiment 4">Experiment 4</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Experiments 1, 2, and 3 indicated that scopolamine disrupts processes common to both memory and discrimination tasks.

Rather, it appears that this selective increase in <em>P</em>(C) was a direct result of the drug action. Furthermore, as the effects of scopolamine were not completely modeled by manipulations of stimulus discriminability, scopolamine probably disrupts processes other than, or in addition to, stimulus perception.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A second major finding of Experiment 4 was that bias tended to decrease (<em>B</em>″ increased) as accuracy approached chance (<em>A</em>′ = .50). The fact that procedural manipulation of discriminability may influence bias at low sensitivity values indicates that the trend toward reduced bias found at higher doses of scopolamine was also a secondary effect of the low levels of sensitivity produced by the drug. Although an interaction of sensitivity and bias is not strictly compatible with the assumptions of the theory of signal detection (<a href="#c16">Green &amp; Swets, 1966</a>), it is not unusual for animals performing in discrimination tasks. Interactions of sensitivity and bias at extreme levels of sensitivity have been reported in several previous studies for which sensitivity and bias were otherwise independent (<a href="#c43">Schusterman &amp; Johnson, 1975</a>; <a href="#c48">Terman &amp; Terman, 1972</a>). A possible explanation is that as accuracy decreases, a smaller portion of choice responses will be reinforced, and responding may therefore extinguish.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because of the possible interaction between sensitivity and bias, the TSD analysis should be interpreted cautiously, particularly when sensitivity is low. Nevertheless, the present experiments demonstrate the usefulness and validity of the TSD analysis over a reasonably wide range of CNM performance. Increasing the stimulus brightness ratio from .04 to .25 decreased <em>A</em>′ by 15% but did not alter bias in Experiment 4. Furthermore, <a href="#c38">Pontecorvo and Heise (1982)</a> showed that bias in the CNM task can be altered independently of sensitivity through manipulation of reinforcement contingencies. In their experiment, partial reinforcement of correct rejections on match trials lowered response bias without altering sensitivity. Thus, both the Pontecorvo and Heise results and the present data suggest that sensitivity and bias are independent in the CNM task provided <em>A</em>′ or <em>B</em>″ do not assume extreme values.</p><a id="bne-99-6-1049-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_125" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In experiments 1 and 2, disruption of central cholinergic transmission by administration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine reduced the accuracy of responding in the continuous nonmatching to sample (CNM) working memory task. This reduction in response accuracy (sensitivity) was accompanied by a decrease in the overall level of responding (bias). If the cholinergic system were responsible for behavioral inhibition (e.g., <a href="#c7">Carlton, 1963</a>), then disruption of cholinergic transmission would be expected to increase response bias by selectively interfering with response inhibition on no-go (match) trials. Instead, scopolamine both increased responding on match trials and decreased responding on go (nonmatch) trials (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Scopolamine produced a greater increase in responding on correction trials than on initial match trials (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). This selective increase in correction trial errors suggests that the drug increased perseveration of incorrect responses (as originally proposed by <a href="#c6">Carlton, 1961</a>). Alternatively, this increase in correction trial responding may reflect an impaired ability to discriminate correction trials from match trials on the basis of a nonreinforced response. This latter hypothesis would account for both the large increase in correction trial errors produced by scopolamine and the superiority of correction trial accuracy over initial match trial accuracy under control conditions. Because responses were never reinforced on a trial following an incorrect response, the rats may have learned to minimize the memory load on correction trials by using nonreinforcement as a cue for not responding. Instead of remembering the stimulus from the previous trial, the rats may have remembered a “prospective response instruction” (i.e., “don't respond on the next trial”; see <a href="#c23">Honig, 1978</a>; <a href="#c24">Honig &amp; Dodd, 1983</a>) or simply engaged in alternative behavior that competed with responding on the lever. Thus, scopolamine may have impaired the rats' ability to utilize the nonreinforced response as a cue and thereby disrupted the prospective mediation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Some evidence concerning these alternative hypotheses can be obtained by comparing the absolute error level on correction trials [<em>P</em>(C)] and initial match trials [<em>P</em>(FA)] under the drug conditions. If the increase in correction trial errors seen with scopolamine represents a selective effect on perseverative errors, then the absolute number of errors as well as the percentage of increase should be greater on correction trials than on initial match trials. The present data indicate that if such a perseverative drug effect exists, it is relatively minor: <em>P</em>(C) was significantly greater than <em>P</em>(FA) for all doses of scopolamine in Experiment 1, but not in Experiments 2 and 3.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A more definitive test of these hypotheses could be made by comparing perseverative errors with switching errors in a two-choice task. This analysis was performed for the effects of scopolamine in a two-lever double alternation task by <a href="#c51">Warburton and Heise (1972)</a>. They reported that scopolamine did not selectively affect the tendency to remain with the same lever rather than to switch to the other lever. Taken together with the present results and those of other recent studies (<a href="#c30">Milar, 1981</a>; <a href="#c31">Milar et al., 1978</a>), current evidence indicates that scopolamine is not disinhibitory and does not produce perseverative tendencies in lever-pressing situations. Rather, the data more uniformly indicate a cholinergic involvement in decision processes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Experiments 1 and 2 also provide no evidence for an intrinsic cholinergic involvement in retention in working memory. Scopolamine disrupted response accuracy equally at all retention intervals. Although floor effects might have influenced the data from Experiment 1, it is unlikely that they influenced the results of Experiment 2. Furthermore, scopolamine has been found to reduce accuracy equally across retention intervals in the CNM task even when retention intervals as short as 1 s have been measured (<a href="#c38">Pontecorvo &amp; Heise, 1982</a>). Thus, the absence of scopolamine effects on retention in Experiments 1 and 2 was not due to a failure to measure performance at very short retention intervals. Nor can it be attributed to a failure to measure performance at sufficiently long retention intervals, because in Experiment 1 the 10-s interval was long enough to reduce performance to chance levels in the 0.50 mg/kg scopolamine condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although a number of experiments have shown that scopolamine can alter stimulus discriminability or perception (<a href="#c13">Evans, 1975</a>; <a href="#c30">Milar, 1981</a>), doses of scopolamine sufficient to block acquisition of classical conditioning in the rabbit do not block the development of latent inhibition to a conditioned stimulus (<a href="#c18">Harvey, Gormezano, &amp; Cool-Hauser, 1983</a>). These results indicate that scopolamine did not alter conditioned stimulus perception or habituation. Furthermore, in the present experiments, results from the LD condition of Experiment 3 showed that the stimuli used in the CNM task were highly discriminable, even under the highest dose of scopolamine (0.50 mg/kg). Experiment 4 also showed that scopolamine produced changes in correction trial performance that could not be modeled by a reduction in the physical difference between the bright and dim discriminative stimuli.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, these results of the CNM experiments clearly and consistently demonstrate that scopolamine does not disrupt retention or strongly affect stimulus perception. However, these results alone are not sufficient to rule out a cholinergic role in working memory. The effects of scopolamine in the CNM task were therefore compared with the effects obtained in a discrimination task with no explicit working memory requirement. If scopolamine affected any process uniquely required in a working memory task, then scopolamine should have disrupted CNM performance more than discrimination performance. Instead, scopolamine produced nearly identical effects in the CNM and SD discrimination tasks (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>). The results suggest that the muscarinic cholinergic system controls processes that are common to both working memory and discrimination tasks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One such process concerns reference memory. <a href="#c45">Spencer and Lal (1983)</a> hypothesized that the predominant effect of centrally acting antimuscarinic drugs was interference with encoding and retrieval processes in reference memory. Accordingly, performance would be impaired equally at all retention intervals in the working memory tasks (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> and <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>), and similar disruption of performance in working memory and discrimination tasks (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>) would be obtained when the baseline levels of accuracy were equivalent. Furthermore, if correction trial performance depends on the retrieval of special rules or processing strategies (i.e., “don't respond following a nonreinforced response”), it would be especially vulnerable to disruption (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). This hypothesis is also consistent with the well-documented effects of cholinergic agonists and antagonists on learning and memory performance in humans (<a href="#c8">Crow &amp; Grove-White, 1973</a>; <a href="#c11">Drachman, 1977</a>) and a variety of animal species (<a href="#c9">Deutsch, 1971</a>; <a href="#c14">Glick &amp; Zimmerburg, 1972</a>; <a href="#c20">Heise et al., 1976</a>; <a href="#c40">Roberts &amp; Bradley, 1967</a>; <a href="#c47">Teal &amp; Evans, in press</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, it should be noted that some experiments have shown anticholinergic effects on working memory retention in monkeys (<a href="#c3">Bartus &amp; Johnson, 1976</a>; <a href="#c34">Penetar &amp; McDonough, 1983</a>; <a href="#c37">Pontecorvo &amp; Evans, 1985</a>). The differences between those and the present results may be due in part to species or procedural differences. The present results suggest two types of variables that offer particular promise for resolving this controversy. First, Experiment 3 showed that scopolamine's effects increase as the control level of response accuracy decreases. This finding has been well documented for discrimination tasks (<a href="#c13">Evans, 1975</a>; <a href="#c28">Ksir, 1975</a>; <a href="#c30">Milar, 1981</a>; see <a href="#c21">Heise &amp; Milar, 1984</a>, for review). However, if this were the case in a working memory task, the magnitude of the drug effect would always increase with retention interval duration (because response accuracy declines with longer retention intervals); this did not occur in the present series of experiments. Therefore, one promising direction for future research is to study the interaction of cholinergic drug treatment with variables such as level of stimulus discriminability and amount of interference from previous trials, which can determine the control levels of response accuracy. It is possible that the discrepancies between effects of cholinergic antagonists on retention observed in different experiments may result from the differential importance of these kinds of variables in different tasks; for example, pilot data from our laboratory suggest that scopolamine may be more likely to alter retention when interference from previous trials is high than when interference is low.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A second avenue of research, suggested by the finding that correction trial performance was more vulnerable to disruption than initial trial performance, is to examine the interaction between cholinergic drug effects and variables that influence the subject's use of mediational information processing strategies. Recent studies (<a href="#c5">Brodigan &amp; Peterson, 1976</a>; <a href="#c24">Honig &amp; Dodd, 1983</a>; <a href="#c29">Maki &amp; Hegvik, 1980</a>; <a href="#c39">Reynolds &amp; Medin, 1981</a>) have shown that such variables may affect the time course of retention in working memory tasks and thus increase the likelihood that they may also contribute to the differences among studies in the effects of cholinergic drug treatments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In conclusion, the present series of experiments has demonstrated the necessity of concurrently evaluating treatment effects on both memorial and nonmemorial behavioral processes. Until such an analysis has been conducted, it is inappropriate and misleading to claim that any particular treatment has specific effects on memory.</p><a id="bne-99-6-1049-ID0E0UB0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_139" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Alpern, H.
