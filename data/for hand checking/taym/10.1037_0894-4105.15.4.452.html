Some researchers have proposed an RH model of alcoholism-related cognitive decline that suggests that functions for which the RH of the brain is normally specialized are differentially affected by the harmful effects of long-term alcoholism relative to those for which the left hemisphere (LH) of the brain is normally specialized (for reviews, see <a href="#c13">Evert &amp; Oscar-Berman, 1995</a>; <a href="#c37">Oscar-Berman, 1992</a>). A number of investigators who independently studied normal chronological aging have also noted that as people age, they become less reliant on functions of the RH and more reliant on functions of the LH (<a href="#c10">Elias, 1979</a>; <a href="#c11">Ellis &amp; Oscar-Berman, 1989</a>; <a href="#c16">Goodglass &amp; Kaplan, 1979</a>; <a href="#c21">Hochanadel &amp; Kaplan, 1984</a>; <a href="#c27">Kaplan, 1980</a>, <a href="#c28">1988</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The similarity in findings for alcoholic and normal aging individuals led to the hypothesis that alcoholism may result in premature aging of the brain (<a href="#c11">Ellis &amp; Oscar-Berman, 1989</a>). In general, the premature aging model suggests that alcoholism is accompanied by the precocious onset of neuroanatomical and behavioral changes typically associated with advancing age because of either the cumulative effects of alcohol ingestion or the increased vulnerability of an aging brain to the toxic effects of alcoholism. According to one version of the premature aging model—the accelerated aging hypothesis—alcoholism may accelerate age-related cognitive decline regardless of the age at which problematic drinking begins (<a href="#c9">Eckardt, Ryback, &amp; Pautler, 1980</a>; <a href="#c35">Noonberg, Goldstein, &amp; Page, 1985</a>). According to another version—the increased vulnerability hypothesis—vulnerability to alcoholism-related brain damage is magnified in problematic drinkers over age 50, which is after the normal manifestations of aging generally begin (<a href="#c24">Jones &amp; Parsons, 1971</a>; <a href="#c29">Klisz &amp; Parsons, 1977</a>). Thus, older people who abuse alcohol may suffer proportionately greater age-related cognitive decline than their nonalcoholic peers, whereas younger alcoholic individuals are not expected to show cognitive impairments relative to younger control participants. Although the accelerated aging and the increased vulnerability versions of the premature aging model differ in the prediction of the age of onset for alcoholism-related cognitive decline, both versions predict that RH functions are more vulnerable in aging alcoholic individuals compared with younger and older nonalcoholic controls.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Attentional functioning is interesting to study with respect to alcoholism and aging because the RH, proposed to be affected by long-term chronic alcoholism and normal chronological aging, is also implicated as playing a specialized role in attentional processing (e.g., <a href="#c14">Gainotti, Messerli, &amp; Tissot, 1972</a>; <a href="#c18">Heilman, Valenstein, &amp; Watson, 1985</a>; <a href="#c19">Heilman &amp; Van Den Abell, 1979</a>, <a href="#c20">1980</a>; <a href="#c30">Mesulam, 1981</a>, <a href="#c31">1990</a>; <a href="#c33">Mosidze, Mkheidze, &amp; Makashvili, 1994</a>; <a href="#c53">Weintraub &amp; Mesulam, 1989</a>; <a href="#c54">Whitehead, 1991</a>). Furthermore, the study of abnormalities in attentional functioning in alcoholic individuals has largely been neglected (e.g., see <a href="#c22">Hunt &amp; Nixon, 1993</a>). Thus, methods used to study attentional processing provide one means with which to further evaluate the claims of the RH models of age- and alcoholism-related cognitive decline.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A visual selective attention task was used in the present study to assess RH specialization for attentional processing in young healthy individuals and to assess potential RH dysfunction in aging and alcoholic individuals. A cued-detection paradigm was used in which a peripherally located precue provided information about the most probable spatial location of a subsequent target letter (<a href="#c43">Posner, 1980</a>). The target letter could appear in either the left visual field (LVF) or the right visual field (RVF), while a distractor letter was simultaneously presented in the opposing visual field.<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup>
Valid, neutral, and invalid cues were used to assess whether any hemispheric differences in attentional processing were due to differences in the extent to which participants benefited from valid cues compared with neutral cues (benefits), or the extent to which they were disadvantaged by invalid cues compared with neutral cues (costs).<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup>
The efficiency of detecting target stimuli following either LH or RH activation for each cue condition was assessed with the <em>d</em>′ measure of sensitivity (<a href="#c17">Green &amp; Swets, 1966</a>). Younger and older nonalcoholic and alcoholic participants were tested on this task.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The following operational definition of RH specialization for selective attentional processing was used to assess whether aging and/or alcoholism was associated with RH functional decline on the task used here. Because of the RH's ability to direct limited attentional resources over a wider spatial array than can the LH (<a href="#c5">Corbetta et al., 1993</a>; <a href="#c20">Heilman &amp; Van Den Abell, 1980</a>; <a href="#c49">Roy et al., 1987</a>), we expected RH specialization for selective attention to be manifested as less reliance on the cues following RH activation. In other words, if the RH is activated by the cue, and if the RH directs attention to a broader spatial array (i.e., not just the LVF), then the cue should not be as critical in helping to detect the target letter, and the target could be processed efficiently regardless of the nature of the cue. Thus, one would expect a reduced (or no) cost effect associated with invalid cues and perhaps a slightly reduced benefit effect associated with valid cues. However, following LH activation, we expected both cost and benefit effects because the LH primarily directs attention to the RVF. Thus, the magnitude of both cost and benefit effects were expected to be smaller following RH activation than following LH activation by the cue.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given this operational definition, a primary goal of our study was to determine whether aging and/or alcoholism disrupted this RH specialization for selective attentional processing. We reasoned that a disruption in the RH's ability to attend to both sides of space might be manifested in one of two ways. The first possibility was that the disrupted RH might be more restricted in its ability to attend to the whole visual field and might attend primarily to the left side of space (in much the same way that the LH primarily mediates attention in the right side of space). One would then expect that the RH would no longer exhibit an enhanced ability to process the target regardless of the validity of the cue (i.e., costs would be evident on invalid cue trials following RH activation). Another possibility was that the RH would no longer be able to efficiently process information from either side of space; thus, performance overall would be impaired following RH activation relative to performance following LH activation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Regardless of the exact nature of the disruption, we were interested in determining whether aging was associated with RH functional decline, whether alcoholism was associated with RH functional decline, and whether any alcoholism effects were independent of, or interacted with, aging effects.

Recall that for the younger participants, an RH advantage for selective attentional processing was characterized by an ability to attend to both sides of space following RH activation, such that the validity of the cue was less critical in directing attention. According to this operational definition of RH specialization, the results for the older controls may be partially consistent with RH functional decline. For the older controls, a significant benefit following RH activation suggests that attention was primarily directed to the LVF and not to both sides of space. Also consistent with this explanation is the finding that detection sensitivity on invalid cue trials was lower than on neutral cue trials for both visual fields; in other words, unlike the younger controls, the older controls did not demonstrate enhanced processing following RH activation regardless of cue validity. However, a deficit in the ability of the RH to direct attention to both sides of space presumably should not interfere with the LH's ability to process information in the right side of space. Thus, the lack of a significant benefit following LH activation poses a problem for a purely RH dysfunction interpretation of the results. Taken together, the older nonalcoholic participants showed a decreased ability to detect targets following LH activation, and they also did not appear to exhibit a preserved ability to attend to a larger region of the visual field following RH activation.</p><a id="neu-15-4-452-ID0EBBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Evidence for the Effects of Alcoholism on RH Performance</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A third goal of this experiment was to assess whether alcoholic participants showed deficits on a selective attention task relative to nonalcoholic control participants and, if so, whether the pattern of results could be accounted for by the RH model of alcoholism-related cognitive decline.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Age × Group × Visual Field × Cue Validity interaction was not significant, <em>F</em>(2, 138) = 1.33.

Furthermore, the alcoholic participants did not benefit from valid cues following RH activation. Taken together, the findings for the alcoholic participants were consistent with the RH model of alcoholism-related cognitive decline, but not with the premature aging hypothesis (i.e., none of the Group × Age interactions with analyses of variance [ANOVAs] were statistically reliable). However, to further address the premature aging hypothesis, we used regression analyses to explore a possible interaction between the effects of aging and alcoholism.</p><a id="neu-15-4-452-ID0EABCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Effects of Alcoholism Interact With Effects of Aging</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To investigate the importance of each of the independent (predictor) variables (group, age, gender, years of sobriety, years of &gt;21 drinks per week, and QFI score) on visual field effects, we first ran separate multiple regression analyses on data from the following: valid LVF, neutral LVF, invalid LVF, valid RVF, neutral RVF, and invalid RVF. In all six of the multiple regression analyses, age and the three drinking variables were treated as continuous variables. None of the six multiple regression analyses proved to be significant. Next, because we were interested in determining whether there was a possible interaction between the separate predictor variables of age and group, we ran six analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) through regression analyses. We found that the inclusion of this interaction factor greatly reduced the probability of making a Type I error in all but one case (i.e., neutral RVF). In addition, as can be seen in <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>, the models containing data from the LVF in all of the ANCOVAs showed significant effects of group (alcoholic participants performed more poorly than controls) as well as a significant interaction between group and age (<em>p</em> &lt; .05).

Results of the principal-components analyses showed clusters among all of the LVF variables and among all of the RVF variables. In other words, across participants, high scores on valid, invalid, and neutral cue conditions occurred together for each visual field separately. To determine the effects of the predictor variables on each of the two visual fields, we ran ANCOVAs through multiple regressions (as described earlier). This time, the dependent variables were the sums of all three LVF scores and the sums of all the RVF scores, and the independent variables were the separate predictors (group, age, Group × Age, gender, and the three drinking variables) and interactions among them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By using stepwise selection, we found that the model for the LVF was significant (<em>p</em> &lt; .05), and the significant predictors were group (alcoholic participants were worse than controls, <em>p</em> &lt; .05), age (older participants were worse than younger participants, <em>p</em> &lt; .05), and Group × Age (the effects of alcoholism decreased with age, <em>p</em> &lt; .05). In other words, the effects of alcoholism and aging were in the direction we expected; that is, performance declined, but the interaction between alcoholism and aging was positive such that the magnitude of alcoholism-related decline decreased with aging. The model for the RVF also was significant (<em>p</em> &lt; .05). Here the significant predictors were group (alcoholic participants were worse than controls, <em>p</em> &lt; .05), age (older participants were worse than younger participants, <em>p</em> &lt; .05), and gender (women performed better than men, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), and there was a significant Age × Gender interaction (aging harmed men less than women, <em>p</em> &lt; .05).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Like the ANOVAs reported above, the results from these analyses do not appear to support the premature aging hypothesis. In fact, the analyses indicated that although the alcoholic participants performed worse overall than the controls, older alcoholic participants performed better than the younger alcoholic participants did. It is not clear what might account for this pattern of results. The fact that this interaction was significant only when the targets were presented in the LVF, however, is consistent with the hypothesis that RH functioning is uniquely affected in alcoholic individuals.</p><a id="neu-15-4-452-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_71" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present study, we used a cued target detection task to establish RH specialization for selective attention in neurologically healthy young control participants as well as to asses potential RH functional decline in aging and alcoholic individuals. The results from the present study suggest the following: (a) The RH appears to play a more specialized role in selective attentional processing in that it has the ability to attend to a larger spatial array than does the LH and is thus less reliant on cues to direct attention; (b) there was an age-related difference in the pattern of results for the nonalcoholic participants such that older nonalcoholic participants showed a decreased ability to detect targets following LH activation, and they did not exhibit a preserved ability to attend to a larger region of the visual field following RH activation; (c) the pattern of results for the alcoholic participants was consistent with the RH model of alcoholism-related cognitive decline; and (d) the pattern of results does not support the premature aging hypothesis; in fact, they suggest that the detrimental effects of alcoholism on RH performance may decrease with age.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the present results support the RH hypothesis of alcoholism-related cognitive decline, it is important to note that this model cannot account for all the difficulties observed in alcoholic individuals. Thus, other views of alcoholism-related cognitive decline have been put forward. The frontal systems hypothesis has been proposed to account for findings of abstraction and problem-solving difficulties as well as personality and emotional changes observed in alcoholic participants (<a href="#c38">Oscar-Berman, 2000</a>). Both the RH and the frontal systems hypotheses are limited in scope, however, because the former does not fully explain deficits in executive functioning and personality changes, and the latter does not explain functional changes generally associated with decline in more posterior regions of the RH (<a href="#c40">Oscar-Berman &amp; Schendan, 2000</a>). Thus, the diffuse brain dysfunction model has been proposed to account for the widespread deficits exhibited by alcoholic participants (<a href="#c41">Parsons, 1987</a>; <a href="#c48">Rourke &amp; Loberg, 1996</a>). This model, however, lacks sufficient heuristic and empirical value to facilitate specific theoretical predictions of alcoholic participants' performance on cognitive tasks. Instead, several theoretical models are needed to completely account for the personality and cognitive changes observed in chronic alcoholic participants. This is not surprising because alcoholism is a multifaceted condition with a variety of genetic, environmental, and constitutional influences (<a href="#c36">Noronha, Eckardt, &amp; Warren, 2000</a>).</p><a id="neu-15-4-452-ID0EAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_75" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn1">1</a></sup> Although behavioral evidence supporting RH specialization for selective attention using cued-detection/response time tasks is mixed under conditions in which a target is presented alone in the visual field (<a href="#c5">Corbetta, Miezin, Shulman, &amp; Petersen, 1993</a>; <a href="#c34">Nagel-Leiby, Buchtel, &amp; Welch, 1990</a>; <a href="#c42">Petersen, Robinson, &amp; Currie, 1989</a>; <a href="#c45">Posner, Walker, Friedrich, &amp; Rafal, 1984</a>; <a href="#c50">Verfaellie, Bowers, &amp; Heilman, 1988</a>), RH specialization is evident under conditions in which the perceptual load of the task is increased (<a href="#c12">Evert, McGlinchey-Berroth, Verfaellie, &amp; Milberg, 2000</a>; <a href="#c49">Roy, Reuter-Lorenz, Roy, Copland, &amp; Moscovitch, 1987</a>). Thus, in the present study, we simultaneously presented a target in one visual field and a distractor letter in the opposing visual field to increase the perceptual load, which we expected would necessitate selective attentional processing and would thus reveal RH specialization.</p><a id="fn2" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn2">2</a></sup> <a href="#c26">Jonides and Mack (1984)</a> pointed out that it is operationally difficult to create a truly neutral condition; for this reason, some researchers have abandoned cost-benefit analyses in favor of simply looking at the magnitude of the difference between valid and invalid cue trials (i.e., overall cue-validity effects). However, even if a significant visual field difference is found in the cue-validity effects, it is not clear whether a larger or a smaller cue-validity effect represents greater hemispheric specialization. Furthermore, one would not be able to determine the locus of this effect (e.g., the engagement of selective attention, the disengagement and moving of attention, or some combination thereof). Thus, it is not clear how one could interpret a visual field difference in overall cue-validity effects without taking the neutral cue condition into consideration. In the present study, we felt that it was important to consider the data by including the neutral cue condition and keeping in mind its potential difficulties.</p><a id="fn3" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn3">3</a></sup> Criteria for classifying someone as alcoholic vary (see <a href="#c1">Abel, Kruger, &amp; Friedl, 1999</a>; <a href="#c8">Eckardt et al., 1998</a>). The amount and duration of ethanol consumption that characterize heavy drinking, alcohol abuse, and alcohol dependence depends on many factors including age, gender, ethnicity, nutrition, physical condition, and health status as well as social factors (see <a href="#c39">Oscar-Berman &amp; Evert, 1997</a>). A minimum criterion of at least 5 years of drinking 21 or more drinks per week is common among studies assessing alcohol-related cognitive decline (e.g., see <a href="#c8">Eckardt et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#c15">Gansler et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#c23">Hutner &amp; Oscar-Berman, 1996</a>). It is important to note, however, that problem-based criteria, not quantity and frequency of consumption, make up a definition for alcohol-use disorders (e.g., see <a href="#c6">Dawson, 1994</a>, <a href="#c7">2000</a>).</p><a id="fn4" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn4">4</a></sup> Each participant was given two practice blocks at the beginning of the testing session. On the basis of each individual participant's overall error rate on the second block, we adjusted the duration of the test display so as to avoid both ceiling and floor effects. The participant was then given two experimental blocks. Because performance could vary depending on the cue-target condition, we performed preliminary data analysis on the first two experimental blocks and administered an unrelated task to the participant. On the basis of this analysis, we made further adjustments to the test display duration, if necessary, and administered six more blocks of trials to the participant to be used in the final data analysis.</p><a id="fn5" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn5">5</a></sup> Trials in which the participant gave no response were excluded from the data analysis (this was less than 0.20% for both the controls and the alcoholic participants). Trials in which a particular participant's response times were more than 2 standard deviations beyond his or her overall mean response time were excluded. This procedure resulted in eliminating, on average, 16 data points for each of the control participants and 14 data points for each of the alcoholic participants.</p><a id="fn6" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn6">6</a></sup> Because the neutral cue condition is a baseline from which benefit and cost effects are calculated to determine whether there are hemispheric asymmetries, we conducted analyses to see whether the results might be due to artifacts associated with the neutral cue condition. After averaging the <em>d</em>′ values for the LVF and the RVF neutral conditions, we found that the magnitude of the benefits did not significantly differ following RH (0.31) and LH (0.39) activation, <em>F</em>(1, 22) = 0.62, but there was still a hemispheric asymmetry for cost effects, <em>F</em>(1, 22) = 4.61, <em>p</em> &lt; .05. As before, when the invalid cue activated the LH, there was a cost effect (0.07), but when the cue activated the RH, processing was enhanced relative to the neutral condition (−0.15). Consistent with the original data, these analyses confirm that the RH has an advantage in that it can attend to a wider spatial region and thus is not as affected as the LH by the invalidity of the cue.</p><a id="neu-15-4-452-ID0E0WB0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_89" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Abel, E.
