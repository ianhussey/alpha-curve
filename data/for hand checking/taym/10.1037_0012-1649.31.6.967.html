mental rotation (<a href="#c12">Kail, Pellegrino, &amp; Carter, 1980</a>),
reading (<a href="#c14">Lorch, Lorch, Gretter, &amp; Horn, 1987</a>),
visual search (<a href="#c6">Gitomer, Pellegrino, &amp; Bisanz, 1983</a>),
and picture and name matching (<a href="#c2">Bisanz, Danner, &amp; Resnick, 1979</a>).
Task completion latencies appear to decline over age at a common rate for different tasks (<a href="#c8">Kail, 1991a</a>).
For example, <a href="#c7">Hale (1990)</a>
tested four age groups (10-, 12-, 15-, and 19-year-olds) on four speeded tasks: (a) letter matching on the basis of name identity, (b) two-choice alternative reaction time (RT), (c) abstract matching, and (d) mental rotation. She found that processing speed increased across all of the tasks at a constant rate up to the age of 15 years. Such data lead to the inference that a general mechanism is responsible for the observed age-related increases in speed (<a href="#c7">Hale, 1990</a>; <a href="#c8">Kail, 1991a</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Using evidence from 72 studies that utilized speed-of-processing measures, <a href="#c8">Kail (1991a)</a>
proposed a quantitative model that expresses child and adolescent RT as a function of adult RT on the same task or tasks (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).
The developmental trajectory proposed by Kail may have a maturational basis, such as the increasing myelinization of the integrative systems in the brain during childhood and adolescence (<a href="#c3">Bjorklund &amp; Harnishfeger, 1990</a>).
Given this possibility, our goal for the present study was to test a general hypothesis that physical maturation influences processing speed in middle childhood. We reasoned that if some central, maturational mechanism contributes to improved processing speed, changes in physical maturation should be accompanied by shorter RTs. To test this idea, we could not use the task-analytic approaches that have characterized past research in this area but instead adopted an individual-differences strategy.<br /><br /><a id="fig1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/796906bd39cf7f05e3b73a095499bf3e/571c1624/pdh/dev/dev-31-6-967-fig1a.gif" alt="dev-31-6-967-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

Predicted youth reaction time (RT) by age as a percentage of adult RT on the same task (from Equation 8, Kail [1991a] )</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">From an individual-differences perspective, between-child variability in physical maturational status would be associated with variations in individual trajectories such as depicted in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.
We assumed that early- and late-maturing children would traverse the path, but at different CAs. Thus, the trajectory of the early maturer would be displaced to the left, and the trajectory of the late maturer would be displaced to the right. If so, a comparison of early and late maturers at a given age during middle childhood would find early-maturing children with shorter RTs than their late-maturing agemates.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although there is not a great deal of empirical evidence for the preceding possibility, there are scattered reports of covariance between physical maturation differences and cognitive performance. <a href="#c18">Tanner (1962)</a>
concluded that children and adolescents who are physically mature for their chronological ages are likely to perform better on mental ability tests than are their less mature agemates.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Perhaps the advantage observed for the more mature child accrues from their faster speed of processing. Such a line of argument is presented by <a href="#c11">Kail and Hall (1994)</a>, who reported general processing speed to be predictive of reading comprehension. They argued that faster processing facilitates the access and integration of symbolic codes necessary for success in reading tasks. Thus, there have been some findings of a maturation effect on cognitive performance, and there are reasons why such an association could arise.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, one reason for the inattention to a maturation–speed connection may arise from the difficulty in studying maturational variation. An accessible, practical measure of childhood maturational status has not been available. Traditional measures of physical maturity such as X-rays of particular bones are worrisome and expensive. Fortunately, a noninvasive, practical technique exists for use with children: relative physical stature (<a href="#c15">Roche, Tyleshevski, &amp; Rogers, 1983</a>; <a href="#c16">Roche, Wainer, &amp; Thissen, 1975</a>).
This technique expresses the child's physical maturity as the ratio of present to estimated adult stature. This latter estimate is calculated by using published formulae applied to the parents' statures and the child's sex, age, weight, and stature. Two children of the same age and height will have different relative statures if one is closer to his or her estimated adult height than is the other. Various traditional measures of physical maturity such as the skeletal age of the left-hand wrist and knee correlate significantly with relative stature, ranging from .38 to .62 for 10-year-olds (<a href="#c15">Roche et al., 1983</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The developmental trajectory for the relative stature measure is illustrated for boys and girls in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, which is drawn from <a href="#c15">Roche et al.'s (1983)</a>
data. Two noteworthy features of the relative stature measure are apparent. First, sex differences are substantial during middle childhood; boys lag girls by nearly 2 years in reaching the same level of relative stature. For example, girls reach 75% of their age 18 height shortly after their 7th birthday, but boys do not reach the same level until age 9. Second, because half of one's adult stature is realized before 3 years, and the remainder is acquired over a decade or more; year-to-year differences in relative stature are small in absolute terms. For example, 6- and 9-year-olds are obviously different in mean height, but on the relative stature measure they differ by only 10% (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).
Thus, relatively small absolute differences in relative stature characterize children at distinctly different developmental levels.<br /><br /><a id="fig2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/84a16c2c4f1928089cc82b85f1185a30/571c1624/pdh/dev/dev-31-6-967-fig2a.gif" alt="dev-31-6-967-fig2a.gif" title="Figure 2.

= 668 ms] suggested that the participant was not attending to the task during that trial). Therefore, such outlying values were truncated to the 1st and 99th percentiles (i.e., all RTs outside these boundaries were assigned the 1st or 99th percentile value, respectively). With this treatment, the outliers remained on the tails of the distribution but their impact on any measure of central tendency was reduced. Despite this modification of extreme outliers, the trial data remained positively skewed. Therefore, before calculating a mean, we transformed each RT in the distribution of RT values for a task with the common logarithm (see <a href="#c17">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 1989</a>).
This ensured that any mean RT value based on the trial data would not be unduly influenced by a small number of trials with long response latencies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Task percentages</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To summarize each child's individual task performance, we calculated the mean logged RT from accurate trials only and then applied the antilog to reconvert the mean back into milliseconds.

Furthermore, although the age range of the children was restricted to 1 year, the selection of extreme quartiles on the maturity dimension resulted in age differences between the earlies and the lates (see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>).

Our tasks, which were modified versions of those used by <a href="#c7">Hale (1990)</a>, were strongly intercorrelated, so we created a composite speed measure. Although this composite measure did not correlate significantly with age within the narrow age range (9.4 to 10.5 years) of our study (<em>r</em>
= −.19), it fit well with <a href="#c8">Kail's (1991a)</a>
theoretical RT trajectory. Indeed, if one did not know that the curve in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>
was theoretically based, one might well assume that it was derived from our data. Thus, we were confident that our procedures captured the critical aspects of the speed–age relation found by others.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We then turned to the second key assumption, that of sex differences in maturational status. Although girls and boys were in the same school grade, they differed substantially in relative physical stature. For the full sample of children (before extreme quartiles were selected), the girls' mean on relative stature was 1.66 standard deviations above that of the boys'. In fact, the distributions for girls and boys were almost nonoverlapping, and a girl at the 10th percentile for girls would have been at the 95th percentile for boys. Had we drawn our extreme groups from the combined sample of boys and girls, virtually all early maturers would have been girls and all late maturers would have been boys, so we selected extreme quartiles within gender. Moreover, because sex differences would have been confounded with maturity differences in an overall analysis, we analyzed maturity effects separately by gender, which controlled for the sex–maturity confound.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Physical maturity is also strongly correlated with, and is difficult to disentangle from, CA. To sharpen our focus on maturity, we narrowed our CA range to 1 year to minimize any correlation between CA and performance. We also minimized the possible influence of differing amounts of school exposure on our cognitive measures by testing all children within a 1-month period. Much individual variability in processing speed remained despite such procedural restrictions (see <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>),
and we turned to our main hypothesis, that early maturers would perform faster on information-processing speed tasks than late maturers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The hypothesis found support in that the overall test of the maturity effect was significant before CA was covaried and fell narrowly short of conventional significance (<em>p</em>
&lt; .08) after CA was covaried. More specifically, the planned within-sex comparisons revealed that early- and late-maturing girls showed a small but nonsignificant difference in the hypothesized direction, whereas early-maturing boys were, as hypothesized, significantly faster than their late-maturing agemates. Several interpretative possibilities arise from the planned comparisons results. First, the sample size may have been too small to detect a maturity effect for both boys and girls. Second, the maturity effect could be truly specific to boys. Third, the maturity effect may be specific to the 75%–80% range of physical maturity, and this female sample was past this developmental phase. It is to these three possibilities that we now turn.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In hindsight, a larger sample should have been used. We now realize that sample sizes characteristic of experimental, information-processing studies are probably inadequate for individual-differences designs. <a href="#c13">Kyllonen, Tirre, and Christal (1991)</a>
argued that large sample sizes are critical for individual-differences hypotheses because the ratio of variability to effect size is typically larger in such studies than in those that compare treatment groups. Future applications of an individual-differences strategy to the maturation hypothesis will benefit from larger samples, and we expect a maturity effect to emerge for girls as well as boys in more powerful studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of course, it is possible that large-sample studies will find a male-specific maturity effect, and there is scattered evidence for this possibility. <a href="#c5">Eaton and Speed (1995)</a>
hypothesized that physically mature children would exceed their less mature classmates on two standardized tests of phonological ability, one measuring the repetition of aurally presented pseudowords and the other, the reading of pseudowords. Phonological skills were assessed for ninety-four 5- to 11-year-old children, and physical maturities were also estimated from relative stature. After the effects of CA had been removed, individual differences in physical maturity predicted pseudoword repetition, and this effect was limited to boys.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A male-specific effect was also uncovered in a large-sample study by <a href="#c4">Duke et al. (1982)</a>.
They compared early-, mid-, and late-maturing adolescents on academic grades, achievement test scores, IQ, and educational aspirations. They found that early-maturing boys outperformed mid-maturing boys, who outperformed late-maturing boys on all these variables, whereas no maturity differences were found for girls.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The preceding studies, however, have nothing directly to do with processing speed (although processing speed may underlie other abilities such as reading comprehension [<a href="#c11">Kail &amp; Hall, 1994</a>
]), and a case for male specificity in maturity effects is tentative at best. Certainly, sex differences in the asymptotic speeds for various tasks have been reported (<a href="#c9">Kail, 1991b</a>),
but the need for sufficiently large samples to study possible interactions between sex and rate of development has probably discouraged the evaluation of possible gender-differentiated developmental trajectories.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As noted earlier, the present pattern of results could also be the product of developmental timing differences between girls and boys. In middle childhood, boys are substantially less physically mature than their female agemates, and most of the increase in processing speed may have occurred for girls before the age of 9. Certainly, RTs decrease markedly in early and middle childhood, and perhaps we glimpsed the female sample after they had undergone rapid change in processing speed. This particular possibility could be tested in future studies by comparing younger early- and late-maturing girls who are in the same relative maturity range (75%–80% of adult stature) as the boys in this study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">If a maturity effect were to emerge in such a comparison of younger girls, it would be consistent with our initial assumption that boys and girls follow the same developmental trajectories, with boys lagging girls. Our results, however, hint at a more complex picture. If maturation is the key factor and if girls are more mature (which they are), they should be faster than same-age boys (but they are not). Our displacement hypothesis would have predicted that the female means in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>
would have been lower and would have continued the curve implied by the male means. However, because girls are more mature but not faster, factors other than simple maturational timing differences are implicated. The nature of those factors is not clear, but the present study points to a role for maturation in processing speed development during middle childhood, and the possibility of such a role has been largely overlooked by current information-processing models.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Physical maturity and speed of processing appear to follow general developmental trajectories, and the present study was an initial step toward relating the two. Our individual-differences strategy capitalized on naturally occurring variation in physical maturity to test the prediction that early maturation is associated with faster processing speed. There was a tendency for early maturers to be faster than late maturers generally, and this finding was clearly apparent for boys. Larger samples will be needed in future studies to determine the generality of a physical maturity component for information-processing speed.</p><a id="dev-31-6-967-ID0EAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_86" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn1">1</a></sup> <a href="#c7">Hale's (1990)</a>
