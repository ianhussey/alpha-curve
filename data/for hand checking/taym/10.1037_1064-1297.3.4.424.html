Additionally, Participants 1, 2, and 3 were exposed to the test conditions with PO methadone availability (30 mg), whereas Participants 4–9 had the option of receiving IM methadone (15 mg). The present data tentatively suggest that the route of administration was not an important factor in the enhanced craving seen during precipitated opiate withdrawal.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Drug <em>craving </em>
refers to an internal state that is often used to describe antecedent or concurrent aspects of compulsive self-administration behavior. Although this topic arouses spirited debate (see <a href="#c7">Kozlowski &amp; Wilkinson, 1987</a>)
and the use of this term is becoming more pervasive, there is limited consensus on the theoretical status and practical importance of craving (<a href="#c11">Pickens &amp; Johanson, 1992</a>).
From an experimental view, it would be useful for empirical studies to define the stimulus properties of craving and develop an economical and reliable method for measuring such events. Determining whether drug craving is best measured with one item versus a multidimensional approach is an important first step. From a clinical perspective, in our attempt to understand behavioral repertoires of drug abusers and to develop effective treatments, we ought not to neglect potential approaches for evaluating the likelihood of drug taking. Because craving often occurs in states of drug deprivation (i.e., withdrawal) in individuals who are physically dependent, systematically studying craving in this context might provide information relevant to this goal.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c6">Kanof et al. (1992)</a>
presented data on the characteristics of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in human volunteers who were dependent on methadone. Under double-blind conditions, 20 men maintained on 24 mg per day of oral methadone were administered placebo or one of four doses of naloxone (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 mg intravenously). The severity of the withdrawal syndrome, mood, cognitive performance, and autonomic parameters was measured at 15 and 70 min after administration of naloxone or placebo. Drug craving was measured by a single item on the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (<a href="#c5">Handelsman et al., 1987</a>),
which asked volunteers to rate on a scale ranging from 1 (<em>do not agree</em>)
to 4 (<em>strongly agree</em>)
their agreement with the statement, “I feel like shooting up now.” Naloxone produced significant dose-related increases in standard measures of opiate withdrawal (e.g., increases in blood pressure and marked dysphoria); however, only one participant reported an increase in drug craving on the single item of the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale. These investigators attributed the general absence of reports of drug craving during the period of withdrawal to the fact that volunteers were aware that an opiate was not available during test sessions. This hypothesis, derived from previous work by <a href="#c9">Mirin, Meyer, &amp; McNamee (1976)</a>, predicts that the intensity of heroin craving should be potentiated when it is perceived as available.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present study assessed subjective craving using a multi-item Heroin Craving Questionnaire (<a href="#c15">Tiffany, Fields, Singleton, Haertzen, &amp; Henningfield, 1995</a>;
see Appendix) during naloxone-precipitated opiate withdrawal and also determined whether the intensity of drug craving is augmented when an opiate drug is made immediately available. The purpose of this study was to begin a systematic evaluation of drug craving, including the type of assessment approach (e.g., uni-vs. multidimensional), the relative role of pharmacological and environmental influences on craving, and its potential relationship to illicit drug use in the clinical setting.</p><a id="pha-3-4-424-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_12" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="pha-3-4-424-ID0EDCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board.

Volunteers were informed that if any drug not given by the experimenters was detected in their urine, they would be dismissed from the study.

On these two sessions, the participant's bottle of methadone containing their regular dose was brought into the experimental room and placed so that it could be seen by the volunteer from the start of the session. On the other two sessions (one naloxone and one saline), participants were told in advance that methadone would not be available until the regular time (12 noon) so that the full period of withdrawal could be studied. For the last 6 participants, the procedure was identical, except that a 15-mg dose of methadone was available in a syringe for IM injection by the nurse. These individuals received the remainder of their methadone dose orally at 12 noon. Because methadone is approximately twice as potent when given IM as opposed to PO (<a href="#c2">Beaver, Wallenstein, Houde, &amp; Rogers, 1967</a>),
30 mg was subtracted from the usual daily dose of methadone if volunteers had received an IM dose of methadone.

offered up to $5 as an alternative to self-administering an extra dose of methadone (i.e., in addition to the daily maintenance dose). The present study used an amount that was somewhat higher than the Stitzer et al. study. It was reasoned that the aversiveness of the opiate withdrawal state might potentiate drug-taking behavior and thus require a relatively higher cost to offset this increased likelihood of self-administration.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>General study procedures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This study was conducted at the National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program (Baltimore, MD) residential research unit.

Participants were seated in a comfortable recliner that faced a computer screen and keyboard. Subjective effects questions were presented on the computer screen, and participants recorded their answers by pressing the appropriate computer keys. To insure that participants could operate the computer keyboard quickly and accurately, the first three sessions were used as practice to familiarize the volunteers with the procedures.

At 10:00 a.m. on Sessions 4, 6, 8, and 10, either naloxone or saline was administered. Physiological signs were measured and the battery of opiate effects, mood, and craving scales was completed at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the test injection. A trained nurse observer scored the presence or absence of withdrawal signs at the same time points. Although sessions were conducted every weekday, no injections were administered on Sessions 5, 7, 9, and 11 to minimize carryover effects of precipitated withdrawal.

Sixteen items assessed antagonist effects <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup>
and 16 items assessed agonist effects.<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup>
The participant rated each item on a scale from 0 (<em>not at all</em>)
to 4 (<em>extremely</em>).
Agonist and antagonist items were summed into separate subscale scores for data analysis. Affective state was assessed using a 72-item experimental version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS; <a href="#c8">McNair, Lorr, &amp; Droppleman, 1971</a>).
Participants rated each item on a scale from 0 (<em>not at all</em>)
to 4 (<em>extremely</em>).
Eight clusters (scales) of items have been derived using factor analysis. These eight scales (Anxiety, Elation, Friendliness, Vigor, Depression, Fatigue, Confusion, Anger) have names to describe the adjectives in the cluster. The value of each scale was calculated by adding the numbers for each adjective in the cluster and dividing the total by the number of adjectives in that cluster. Two additional (unvalidated) scales were derived from the other scales as follows: Positive Mood = (Elation − Depression) and Arousal = (Anxiety + Vigor) − (Fatigue + Confusion). Opiate craving was measured using both a single-item score (“I feel like shooting up now;” <a href="#c5">Handelsman et al., 1987</a>)
and the 45-item Heroin Craving Questionnaire (HCQ; <a href="#c15">Tiffany et al., 1995</a>;
see also Appendix). The volunteer was instructed to answer each item on a scale from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>)
to 7 (<em>strongly agree</em>).
Factor analysis of the HCQ yields a general factor (comprised of 34 of the 45 items) and four independent factors that are derived from these 34 items (Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 contribute 14, 9, 7, and 4 items to the general factor, respectively).</p><a id="pha-3-4-424-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Data Analysis</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Each measure was entered into a three-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with drug challenge (naloxone, saline), methadone availability (yes, no), and session time [−15 (baseline), 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min] relative to drug challenge as variables.

(1992)</a>
showed that naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in methadone-maintained volunteers produced characteristic changes in physiology and mood, but not the single-item measure of craving, “I feel like shooting up now.” The present study replicated those results. <a href="#c6">Kanof et al. (1992)</a>
suggested that failure to produce a change in this single-item craving measure was due to participants' knowledge that it was not possible to obtain a drug to “shoot up.” This interpretation was based on work by <a href="#c9">Mirin et al. (1976)</a>, who found that heroin-dependent volunteers reported less drug craving when maintained on naltrexone than when not treated with naltrexone. <a href="#c9">Mirin et al. (1976)</a>
suggested that, although heroin was available to participants for self-administration, naltrexone blocked heroin's pharmacological effects—making it functionally unavailable. This suggests that opiate craving may depend on both the individual's ability to obtain the drug and to experience its positive effects. In this study, however, drug craving was assessed in a qualitatively different functional state, one in which consuming an available opiate would relieve withdrawal distress. Therefore, it is difficult to compare directly results of these studies. Clearly, any complete account of drug craving and its relationship to self-administration would have to consider variations in pharmacological state (e.g., antagonist blockade vs. antagonist-precipitated withdrawal) and ease of drug availability.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Responses to the single-item craving score did not significantly differ across test sessions. This result is surprising because, on the 2 days when methadone was available, the vehicle (i.e., bottle [PO] or syringe [IM]) containing the drug was visible to the participant during the session. In contrast, multi-item assessment of drug craving with the HCQ revealed significant changes. As <a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>
C and 1D show, peak craving scores coincided temporally with peak changes in withdrawal symptoms and mood (i.e., 15 min after naloxone). Interestingly, craving scores did not show sustained elevations; scores began to decrease at 30 min after naloxone, even as signs and symptoms of withdrawal showed sustained increases. Although craving scores tended to be greater during withdrawal symptoms when methadone was available, the number of participants in this study may have been insufficient for these differences to approach statistical significance. Clearly, a more detailed temporal analysis of the onset and offset of craving under various experimental conditions would be useful in further research. Also, because naloxone-precipitated effects are short-lived and participants knew the deprivation interval would be short, this may have limited the intensity or duration of craving score elevations. Thus, using a longer acting opiate antagonist (e.g., naltrexone) and a longer opiate agonist deprivation interval might enhance drug craving and the probability of self-administration.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The putative role of craving in drug abuse and relapse has received much attention in the popular and professional literature. As <a href="#c11">Pickens and Johanson (1992)</a>
noted, there are problems with using this hypothetical construct to explain drug-seeking behavior. The first and most basic issue concerns adequately defining drug craving and, second, ensuring the validity and reliability of its measurement. This study illustrates these issues. The rating of intensity of the single item “I feel like shooting up now” would seem to be a suitable measure of drug craving and has been used previously for this purpose (<a href="#c6">Kanof et al., 1992</a>).
Yet when volunteers are given doses of naloxone that produce large changes in autonomic measures and aversive mood (here and in <a href="#c6">Kanof et al., 1992</a>),
responses to this question do not change. Conversely, HCQ questions that seem related to the single item (e.g., items loading on Factor 1) showed significant increases. Thus, whether the opiate withdrawal state occasions craving for an opiate agonist depends on how one measures craving. It may not suffice to use single items even if they have face validity (<a href="#c14">Tiffany, 1992</a>).
However, it should be noted that there are potential limitations of the HCQ for this study. Specifically, craving questions are worded with regard to heroin, rather than methadone, and normative data for this questionnaire were obtained in opiate-abusing, not opiate-dependent, volunteers. Even so, the HCQ was sensitive to the precipitated withdrawal manipulation in this study and warrants further study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Only one individual who entered this study took methadone during a naloxone test session. However, this person experienced intense withdrawal, including myoclonic leg movements (“kicking the habit”), and was discharged from the protocol. All volunteers were patients enrolled in local treatment programs; although results of each volunteer's participation were confidential, patients might suppress behaviors contrary to treatment goals to please their counselors. Thus, demand characteristics of the test setting could have minimized drug-taking behavior. However, a more compelling reason why volunteers may not have taken methadone when available was that they would lose $10. Previous data indicate that competing money reinforcers can modulate self-administration. <a href="#c13">Stitzer et al. (1983)</a>
allowed methadone patients to choose an extra single methadone dose (0 to 50 mg PO, in addition to their clinic dose) or a money alternative ($1 or $5) on each occasion. Choice of methadone was not only a function of its dose but was also modified by the value of the money alternative. Supplemental methadone doses were more frequently selected when $1 was the alternative relative to when the alternative was $5. Another possible reason why methadone was not taken in this study might be that volunteers knew they would receive their regular methadone dose within the next 90 min (i.e., there was a short delay until drug reinforcement even if participants did not choose methadone to relieve withdrawal distress). Future research could examine this possibility by testing the effects on drug-taking behavior and craving of choosing either a delayed drug reinforcer or an immediate alternative nondrug reinforcer. Finally, it should be noted that measures of opiate craving were already decreasing at the time the early methadone was offered (30 min after naloxone).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The lack of concordance between craving and drug taking in this study is consistent with the limited experimental evidence. Studies by Fischman and her colleagues have shown that measures of craving and drug taking are dissociable (<a href="#c3">Fischman, Foltin, Nestadt, &amp; Pearlson, 1990</a>; <a href="#c4">Foltin &amp; Fischman, 1994</a>).
When cocaine abusers were treated with desipramine, cocaine craving scores (as measured by the visual analog scale, “I want cocaine”) decreased, but cocaine self-administration was unaffected (<a href="#c3">Fischman et al., 1990</a>).
In contrast, when cocaine abusers were treated with buprenorphine, cocaine self-administration decreased but reports of craving on the “I want cocaine” scale were unaltered (<a href="#c4">Foltin &amp; Fischman, 1994</a>).
A similar dissociation has been found in tobacco smokers. <a href="#c10">Nemeth-Coslett and Henningfield (1986)</a>
showed that administration of nicotine chewing gum decreased tobacco intake while measures of the desire to smoke were unaffected. Taken together, these data suggest that craving and increased probability of drug self-administration may both be related to other variables (e.g., withdrawal states, drug-associated environmental cues) but that craving is not causally related to increased drug taking. Thus, it seems unwarranted at this stage of investigation to use drug craving as a surrogate measure of drug self-administration.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Does this mean that measures of drug craving and efforts to alleviate craving through medications or behavioral interventions are of little importance? Regardless of whether drug craving stimulates drug taking or relapse after a period of abstinence, patients typically report craving; this craving is associated with excessive rumination about drugs, which is both distracting and aversive. Efforts to provide pharmacological or behavioral means to control drug craving may not necessarily result in abstinence, but they might palliate the distress and behavioral inefficiency associated with a habitual focus on drug seeking. To develop such interventions, it is essential to have laboratory procedures that reliably produce craving so that this phenomenon—preferably in conjunction with drug self-administration methods—can be studied systematically. The present study shows some potential complexities of this effort.</p><a id="pha-3-4-424-ID0EAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_79" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn1">1</a></sup> Antagonist items (Antagonist scale) were yawning, restless, watery eyes, runny nose, sick to stomach, irritable, tense and jittery, chills or gooseflesh, sweating, hot or cold feelings, abdominal cramps, backache, skin clammy and damp, muscle cramps, painful joints, and heavy–sluggish feeling.</p><a id="fn2" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn2">2</a></sup> Agonist items (Agonist scale) were nodding, dry mouth, turning of stomach, skin itchy, relaxed, coasting, pleasant sick, drive (energy), nervous, good mood, high, sleepy, drunken, soapbox (talkative), rush, and friendly.</p><a id="fn3" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn3">3</a></sup> Relative to saline, 7 participants (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9) showed naloxone-precipitated Antagonist scale increases (Participants 4 and 6 showed increases only when methadone was available), whereas Participants 3 and 7 did not. Consistent with our expectations, only Participants 1, 2, 5, and 8 (i.e., all reported precipitated withdrawal symptoms) showed increased HCQ Factor 1 scores.
