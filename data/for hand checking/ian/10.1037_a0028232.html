Despite a lack of direct access to others' minds, humans have a unique capacity to infer the mental states of other people. Explaining how humans so fluently perceive others' thoughts and feelings poses a persistent challenge to social psychology. Luckily, perceivers have privileged access to a mental system that is highly representative of those that they are trying to understand: their own minds. Indeed, simulation theories of social cognition capitalize on the possibility that one's own mental experiences can serve as a model for the experiences of others. The simulation strategy of mentalizing suggests that perceivers use their own characteristics or likely choices as a source of relevant information when inferring another person's personality, preferences, or perspective. Although humans cannot ever directly access the goings-on of others' minds, we can gain insight into the ways that others think or feel by simulating their experience in our own mind. For example, to infer another's mental state, one might first mentally imagine experiencing that person's situation, read off the evoked mental state, and then assume that the other person would feel similarly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, indiscriminately projecting self-knowledge onto others will not result in successful or efficient social inferences. For simulation strategies to work properly, a perceiver must have experiences that are relevant to those of the social inference target. If this is not the case, a perceiver's self-knowledge likely will not apply to the target and so cannot provide an informative starting point for understanding the target's experience. At the same time, the perceiver must acknowledge that she is not identical to the social target. The perceiver must correct away from self-knowledge to account for residual dissimilarities between self and other. Before simulation theories can claim a complete understanding of how people make social inferences, both of these conditions must first be understood. To that end, this article will investigate (a) factors that influence the relevance of self-knowledge in social inferences and (b) the cognitive mechanisms by which people accomplish correction.</p><a id="xge-142-1-151-ID0EGCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_11" title="Self and Social Inferences">Self and Social Inferences</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Previous social psychology research supports the notion that people use what they know about their own mind to infer the thoughts and feelings of others. For example, people tend to overestimate the extent to which others hold the same opinions (<a href="#c24">Krueger &amp; Clement, 1994</a>; <a href="#c30">Ross, Greene, &amp; House, 1977</a>) or engage in the same activities (<a href="#c1">Allport, 1924</a>; <a href="#c27">Nickerson, 1999</a>) as oneself, a bias known as the <em>false consensus effect</em>. Furthermore, people find it especially difficult to accurately represent the mental states of someone who lacks knowledge that they themselves hold. For example, research on <em>hindsight bias</em> (<a href="#c9">Fischhoff, 1975</a>; <a href="#c10">Fischhoff &amp; Beyth, 1975</a>), <em>curse of knowledge</em> effects (<a href="#c5">Camerer, Loewenstein, &amp; Weber, 1989</a>; <a href="#c22">Keysar &amp; Bly, 1995</a>; <a href="#c23">Keysar, Ginzel, &amp; Bazerman, 1995</a>), and <em>false belief</em> tasks (<a href="#c34">Wellman, Cross, &amp; Watson, 2001</a>) illustrate that people consistently overestimate the extent to which others can access information to which they alone are privy (<a href="#c8">Epley, Keysar, Van Boven, &amp; Gilovich, 2004</a>). The salience of self-knowledge also causes people to consistently overestimate the extent to which others can access their own internalized thoughts, feelings, and experiences (<a href="#c16">Gilovich, Medvec, &amp; Savitsky, 2000</a>; <a href="#c17">Gilovich, Savitsky, &amp; Medvec, 1998</a>; <a href="#c33">Vorauer &amp; Claude, 1998</a>), and to inaccurately assess their own strengths and weaknesses relative to the comparable strengths and weaknesses of others (<a href="#c24">Krueger &amp; Clement, 1994</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recent neuroimaging studies also suggest that perceivers use their own introspection to understand the minds of others. The same neural region—the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)—supports both introspection about the self (<a href="#c21">Kelley et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#c28">Northoff et al., 2006</a>) and inferences about the mental states of others (<a href="#c12">Frith &amp; Frith, 1999</a>; <a href="#c13">Gallagher et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#c14">Gallagher, Jack, Roepstorff, &amp; Frith, 2002</a>). A meta-analysis demonstrated considerable overlap for thinking about both self and other in this particular region of the MPFC (<a href="#c4">Amodio &amp; Frith, 2006</a>). Furthermore, studies that directly compared thinking about the self and thinking about another target also suggest that these two processes share a common neural basis (<a href="#c20">Jenkins, Macrae, &amp; Mitchell, 2008</a>; <a href="#c25">Mitchell, Banaji, &amp; Macrae, 2005</a>; <a href="#c26">Mitchell, Macrae, &amp; Banaji, 2006</a>).

According to the similarity contingency model of mentalizing (<a href="#c3">Ames, 2004b</a>), perceivers use one of two strategies to make social inferences, depending on the perceived similarity of the target. Perceivers rely more on self-knowledge when a target is similar to the self because of shared group membership, attitudes, or beliefs (<a href="#c2">Ames, 2004a</a>, <a href="#c3">2004b</a>); in contrast, perceivers rely more on stereotypes when a target is dissimilar from the self.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recent neuroimaging studies have also investigated how people mentalize about similar and dissimilar others. These studies have shown that mentalizing about people similar to oneself recruits regions associated with self-referential processing, in the ventral aspect of the medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC; <a href="#c20">Jenkins et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#c26">Mitchell et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that mentalizing about similar others recruits the same cognitive processes as self-referential thought. In contrast, mentalizing about dissimilar others recruits a different region from the one used for thinking about the self and similar others (<a href="#c26">Mitchell et al., 2006</a>). These results suggest that, whereas mentalizing about similar others recruits self-referential thought, mentalizing about dissimilar others recruits a different cognitive process.</p><a id="xge-142-1-151-ID0EECAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_21" title="Anchoring and Adjustment">Anchoring and Adjustment</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As described earlier, both behavioral and neuroimaging research suggests that people often recruit self-knowledge when solving social inference problems—particularly about similar others. However, to successfully infer another person's thoughts or feelings, a perceiver must recognize that the other person's experiences are not identical to her own. Thus, in addition to relying on self-knowledge during a social inference, perceivers must also correct for differences between the self and other; that is, they must account for idiosyncrasies of the social target. In other words, although the self may serve as a relevant starting point for a social inference, perceivers must also correct away from this starting point, granting each individual her own unique experiences. Simulation accounts of social inferences must therefore also provide a mechanism for how people correct away from the egocentric anchor point.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research by <a href="#c32">Tversky and Kahneman (1974)</a> suggested one possible mechanism for correction: “anchoring-and-adjustment.” To make judgments with underdetermined answers, individuals will first recruit a relevant piece of information to serve as an anchor, or starting point, away from which they then adjust when searching for the correct answer. For example, if asked to estimate the number of U.S. states in 1880, a person might first recruit a relevant piece of information, such as 50, the current number of states, or 13, the number of original colonies. The number 50 or 13 in this example anchors subsequent responses. Importantly, these anchors are self-generated, relevant to the inference, and close—but not equal—to the correct answer. Because neither 13 nor 50 represents the actual number of states in 1880, people will subsequently adjust away from these anchors to the eventual response. Insufficient adjustment often results in responses biased toward the anchor. For example, people who respond after first thinking about the current number of states (50) tend to overestimate the actual value, whereas those individuals who first think about the number of original colonies (13) tend to underestimate the actual value (<a href="#c7">Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2004</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Researchers have defined adjustment as a serial process (<a href="#c6">Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2001</a>, <a href="#c7">2004</a>). That is, people start at their anchor point and then, with time and cognitive effort, they can adjust farther and farther away from this value. When response time is restricted or cognitive capacity is depleted, people instead adjust shorter distances away from their starting anchor point (<a href="#c8">Epley et al., 2004</a>). Such findings, showing that adjustment takes time and cognitive effort to unfold from start to completion, provide evidence that adjustment proceeds serially. Additional evidence for adjustment as serial comes from research that manipulates the likelihood that individuals will choose to cease correction at different stages of adjustment. Specifically, nodding the head encourages agreement, whereas shaking the head encourages disagreement (<a href="#c11">Förster &amp; Strack, 1996</a>; <a href="#c35">Wells &amp; Petty, 1980</a>). Accordingly, nodding encourages people to agree with values earlier during serial adjustment, whereas shaking the head makes one more likely to disagree with early values and continue to adjust further. As a result, people adjust less when nodding their head than when shaking their head (<a href="#c6">Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2001</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Social inferences share a number of key features with the nonsocial judgments for which researchers originally identified the process of anchoring-and-adjustment. First, social inferences recruit self-knowledge as a relevant, accessible, and self-generated anchor point. Second, social inferences have underdetermined answers, since one can never know the contents of another person's mind with full certainty. Third, social inferences require cognitive effort to correct away from automatically generated anchors (<a href="#c15">Gilbert, 1989</a>). This high degree of congruence between social and nonsocial judgments suggests that the process of anchoring-and-adjustment may play a role in social as well as nonsocial inferences. If self-knowledge anchors social inferences, then adjustment provides a plausible mechanism for how perceivers correct away from such anchors to account for dissimilarities between self and other.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A few studies on the spotlight effect and the illusion of transparency already provide evidence that people may invoke adjustment to correct from self-knowledge anchors during social inferences (<a href="#c16">Gilovich et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#c17">Gilovich et al., 1998</a>). In one study, participants reported the responses they considered before giving their final estimate of another person's mental state. These responses most often fell between the final response and the self-knowledge anchor (<a href="#c16">Gilovich et al., 2000</a>). Because adjustment is a serial process, this intermediate response provides indirect evidence that participants used adjustment to correct away from the anchor, through the intermediate response, and onwards toward the final response. Recent neuroimaging research suggests that people may use a process of anchoring-and-adjustment during social inferences by demonstrating that neural responses in the MPFC, a region involved in both self-knowledge and social inferences, correlates with the magnitude of adjustment away from a self-anchor when inferring others' mental states (<a href="#c31">Tamir &amp; Mitchell, 2010</a>). Finally, a study by <a href="#c8">Epley et al. (2004)</a> supports the role of egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment in social inferences. When participants in this study had less time or motivation to respond about another person's knowledge state, their estimates were closer to the self-knowledge anchor. Because serial adjustment requires both time and effort to unfold, this finding provides further evidence that participants used adjustment to correct away from their anchor. Interestingly, these authors speculated that individuals may invoke an anchoring-and-adjustment strategy only for similar but not dissimilar targets (<a href="#c8">Epley et al., 2004</a>), though this hypothesis has yet to be tested.</p><a id="xge-142-1-151-ID0EDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_29" title="The Current Study">The Current Study</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current study aims to integrate and extend research on three aspects of social inferences: (a) the role of the self in social inferences, (b) the effects of target similarity on social inference strategies, and (c) serial adjustment as a potential cognitive mechanism for correcting away from a self-knowledge anchor. Here we test two specific hypotheses about the cognitive mechanism underlying social inferences. First, we hypothesize that anchoring on self-knowledge underlies social inferences for similar but not dissimilar others. Second, we hypothesize that serial adjustment characterizes the mechanism for correcting away from such an anchor during social inferences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because anchoring and adjustment co-occur, we can test these hypotheses concurrently. In two sets of studies, we tested for the presence or absence of adjustment from self anchors during social inferences in the following way: Participants in each study reported their own attitudes and opinions and inferred the attitudes and opinions of a target individual. Importantly, participants judged each of the opinion items once for the self and once for another target, allowing us to calculate the discrepancy between responses for self and other on each item. If perceivers automatically invoke their own opinions when judging the opinions of others, then this self–other discrepancy magnitude represents the extent of correction away from this anchor point on each trial. On the other hand, if the self is not invoked as an anchor, then self–other discrepancy represents a psychologically meaningless construct.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">If perceivers then correct away from this self anchor using serial adjustment, then self–other discrepancy provides a measure of the extent of adjustment on each trial. Because adjustment unfolds serially over time, we can look for evidence of anchoring-and-adjustment by taking advantage of this fact that correction will unfold gradually: Large amounts of adjustment should take longer amounts of time; small amounts of adjustment should take short amounts of time. Thus, if participants invoke serial adjustment away from a self anchor, then self–other discrepancy should be smallest on trials with the shortest response times and largest on trials with the longest response times. As such, a positive linear relation between self–other discrepancy and reaction time served as evidence of adjustment in these studies. Specifically, we tested for this positive linear relation between self–other discrepancy and reaction time using hierarchical linear modeling, nested within subject.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To test whether anchoring-and-adjustment occurs for inferences about similar but not dissimilar others, participants in these studies judged both similar and dissimilar targets. To the extent that egocentric anchoring and serial adjustment is recruited during inferences about similar others, we expected to find evidence of a positive linear relation between self–other discrepancy and reaction time only for similar others and not for dissimilar others.</p><a id="xge-142-1-151-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_36" title="Study 1">Study 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this study, participants with liberal social and political attitudes first completed a block of trials in which they answered questions about their own opinions and attitudes. Subsequently, participants were introduced to two targets, one of whom was manipulated to be similar to the participant and the other to be dissimilar.

Importantly, participants made a judgment on each item once about themselves and then a second time about one of the targets, which allowed us to calculate the discrepancy between the responses for self and for other on each item. We expected that participants would anchor on their own opinion during judgments about the similar but not the dissimilar target. We also expected that participants who invoke a self-knowledge anchor will then correct away from it using serial adjustment, such that the magnitude of self–other discrepancy increases with increasing reaction time. Thus, a positive linear relation between reaction time and self–other discrepancy should only exist for similar targets.</p><a id="xge-142-1-151-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants (<em>n</em> = 25) were recruited via the Harvard University study pool.

Participants indicated their response by clicking with a computer mouse on a line at the bottom half of the screen. The extreme left end of this line was labeled “extremely unlikely” and the extreme right end was labeled “extremely likely.” We used this linear scale to allow adjustment to proceed continuously, uninterrupted by discrete numerical response categories. This continuous scale provided a fine-grained assessment of self–other discrepancy, allowing for a nuanced assessment of its predicted relationship with reaction time. However, participants reported that the task of recording answers by clicking on a line was difficult, so subsequent studies adopted a discrete response scale (see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> for specifics about the design features of each study).<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/5093705827db164065c706bb33254035/571c6a26/pdh/xge/xge-142-1-151-tbl1a.gif" alt="xge-142-1-151-tbl1a.gif" title="Design Features of Studies 1, 2a, and 2b" /><em>Design Features of Studies 1, 2a, and 2b</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For each trial, we recorded reaction time and the <em>x</em> (horizontal) and <em>y</em> (vertical) coordinates of the mouse click in pixels.

Participants were then introduced to two people who they were told had provided information about themselves on an Internet dating website. The two targets, depicted by photographs, were each described with a short seven-sentence paragraph. One paragraph described a target similar to the participant. Because our participants were preselected to be college-aged students with liberal social attitudes, this paragraph described the intended similar target as a socially and politically liberal college student who attended a Northeast college and participated in activities typical of a college student. The other paragraph described a target dissimilar from the participant. This intended dissimilar target was described as a fundamentalist Christian from a Midwest college who was politically active in Republican-sponsored organizations on campus and who endorsed socially conservative attitudes. Participants were given as much time as they needed to read the full descriptions of the two targets and get a sense of each. Targets matched the sex of the participant; photographs were assigned similarity roles randomly for each participant.

If participants anchored on their own attitudes when judging the target, then self–other discrepancy provides a measure of how much participants corrected away from this anchor. Furthermore, if participants corrected away from this anchor using serial adjustment, then this self–other discrepancy value should change as a function reaction time. That is, if participants anchored on the self and then serially adjusted away, self–other discrepancy should be smallest on trials with short reaction times and largest on trials with long reaction times.

Self–other discrepancy served as the dependent variable and was calculated as the absolute difference between the response made for the self in Block 1 and the response made for the target in Block 2, for each of the 240 statements for each of the participants. Reaction time was entered as a predictive factor in the model to assess whether increases in reaction time corresponded to increases in self–other discrepancy. In addition, to test whether egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment was recruited differentially for the similar and the dissimilar targets, we included similarity and the interaction between similarity and reaction time as predictive factors in the model. Similarity in this study was a binary variable determined by the target of judgment (i.e., the similar or dissimilar target).

We found no evidence of such anchoring-and-adjustment when participants judged a dissimilar target.</p><a id="xge-142-1-151-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_68" title="Study 2">Study 2</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 1 demonstrated that participants inferred the attitudes of similar others by anchoring on their own attitudes and then serially adjusting away. In contrast, participants did not evidence this egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment when judging the attitudes of a dissimilar other. However, the design of Study 1 was somewhat artificial in that participants answered all social inference questions after reporting their own attitudes and opinions. In everyday life, perceivers do not explicitly answer questions about themselves before making inferences about others. By requiring participants to report their own attitudes first, Study 1 may have made knowledge about the self highly accessible to the participant. Research on priming suggests that highly accessible information can bias judgments of others (<a href="#c18">Higgins, 1996</a>; <a href="#c19">Higgins &amp; Brendl, 1995</a>). Thus, by artificially heightening the accessibility of knowledge about the self, we may have unduly biased participants to invoke self-knowledge as an anchor during social inferences when they might not have otherwise done so naturally (<a href="#c18">Higgins, 1996</a>; <a href="#c19">Higgins &amp; Brendl, 1995</a>). Although this priming effect cannot explain why participants failed to invoke self-knowledge during inferences about dissimilar others, we designed Studies 2a and 2b to examine the extent to which perceivers spontaneously recruit self-knowledge when thinking about similar others. In Study 2a, participants first reported their own attitudes or opinions for only half of the statements, then judged a target on all of the statements, and finally reported their own attitudes for the remaining half of the statements. In this way, we could compare how participants make social judgments about statements that they had already explicitly answered about themselves to how they make judgments about statements that had not yet been answered about the self. That is, we could compare participants' social inference strategy during the trials with a specifically primed anchor to trials with no primed anchor. In Study 2b, participants made social inferences both before reporting any of their own attitudes and after doing so. In this way, we could compare directly how participants make social judgments about statements before and after explicit priming of any self-knowledge.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For both studies, we expected that participants would recruit the self naturally during a social judgment about a similar other, regardless of whether they had just explicitly expressed, and thus primed, any of their own attitudes. Importantly, because egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment should occur regardless of accessibility of one's own attitude, we continued to expect that it would occur only for similar targets and not for dissimilar targets.</p><a id="xge-142-1-151-ID0EBBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 2a</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Participants</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants (<em>n</em> = 25) were recruited via the Harvard University study pool.

Participation was no longer restricted to people who reported holding liberal sociopolitical views on a prescreening form.

The primary task was identical: Participants made judgments about how likely it was that an attitude or opinion statement would apply to themselves and to a target other. In the first block of trials, participants reported their own attitudes for half of the total statements. In the second block, they inferred the target's attitudes on all of the statements. In the final block, participants reported their own attitudes for the remaining half of the statements. Thus, for half of the social inference trials, participants had previously reported their own attitude. On these trials, participants had a highly accessible anchor. For the other half of the social inference trials, participants had not yet explicitly reported their own attitude. On these trials, participants invoking self-knowledge as an anchor would have to do so spontaneously, without priming. By comparing these two types of trials, we could assess whether participants anchor on self-knowledge spontaneously during social inferences or whether anchoring on self-knowledge requires explicit priming of that specific piece of information.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To avoid possible interference effects of responding about multiple targets, participants made judgments about only one target: the liberal target from Study 1. In addition, we no longer restricted participation to self-reported liberals. Participants were thus no longer likely to be similar to our liberal target and dissimilar to the conservative target. Instead of treating similarity as a dichotomous variable based on the target of inference and presumed similarity, as we did in Study 1, we measured similarity in a more flexible manner in Studies 2a and 2b. This measure of similarity was based on participants' own perceived similarity to each of the targets. As in Study 1, upon conclusion of these studies, participants rated their perceived similarity to the target other, the liberal individual about whom they made inferences, on a scale from 1 (<em>very dissimilar</em>) to 7 (<em>exactly the same</em>). Participants also used this same scale to rate their perceived similarity to the conservative individual to whom they were introduced, though they never made judgments of that target. We calculated the similarity between the participants and the target they judged during the task as the difference between these ratings of similarity to the liberal target and the conservative other. That is, participants who rated themselves as more similar to the liberal target than to the conservative target had positive similarity scores; the greater the difference between similarity ratings for the two targets, the higher the similarity score. Alternatively, participants who rated themselves as equally similar to both targets had similarity scores of 0. Finally, participants who rated themselves as less similar to the liberal target than to the conservative target had negative similarity scores; the greater the difference between the similarity ratings for the two targets, the lower the similarity score. This measure of similarity accounts for individual differences in how participants used the similarity scale. For example, this measure treats participants who preferentially used the lower end of the scale and rated the similar and dissimilar targets as 4 and 1, respectively, the same as those who preferentially used the higher end of the scale and rated the targets 7 and 4, respectively; each participant would be assigned a similarity score of 3. Thus, similarity in this study was defined as relative similarity of the participant to the target individual compared to the conservative other. In addition to providing a more nuanced, continuous measure of similarity for each individual participant, this flexible measure of similarity allowed us to avoid excluding potential participants on the basis of political attitudes or excluding participants on the basis of unexpected dissimilarity to the intended similar target.

Reaction time was included as a predictive variable in the model to test whether self–other discrepancy increased linearly with increasing reaction time. A positive linear relation between self–other discrepancy and reaction time would provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis that participants anchor on self-knowledge and then, with increasing time, serially adjust farther and farther away during social inferences. To assess whether egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment occurred only when the target was relatively similar, we included relative similarity scores and the interaction between similarity scores and reaction time as predictive factors in the model. Similarity in this study was a continuous variable, calculated as the relative similarity ratings made by the participant about the target individual and the conservative other. To assess whether egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment was recruited differentially depending on whether participants had a highly accessible self-knowledge anchor, we also included several other predictive variables in the model: block order, the interaction of Block × Reaction Time, the interaction of Block × Similarity, and the three-way interaction of Block × Reaction Time × Similarity.

On these trials, participants not only were not primed with specific self-knowledge anchors, they were also not primed to think about their personal attitudes or opinions at all.

Simulation accounts of mentalizing suggest that knowledge about the self informs such social inferences. However, self-knowledge may only be relevant if the target of the social inference is a person similar to the self. Here we explored whether people anchor on self-knowledge during judgments of similar but not dissimilar others. When people anchor on self-knowledge, they must then correct for discontinuities between the self and other and account for the unique qualities of the other person. Thus, here we also explored whether people invoke the cognitive process of serial adjustment as the mechanism for accomplishing correction away from a self anchor.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Three studies supported these hypotheses. We consistently found evidence that when participants inferred the attitude of a similar other, they did so by anchoring on self-knowledge and then serially adjusting away. For similar others, participants anchored on self-knowledge after explicitly reporting their own attitudes (Study 1), before explicitly reporting some of their own attitudes (Study 2a), and in the most extreme case, before explicitly reporting any of their own attitudes (Study 2b). Such results suggest that people spontaneously recruit self-knowledge to anchor inferences about similar others, even without primed self-knowledge, and then use serial adjustment to correct away from that anchor. In contrast, participants never showed evidence of egocentric anchoring and adjustment during inferences about dissimilar others. This was the case even when the experimental design particularly heightened the accessibility of self-knowledge as a potential anchor.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings remained consistent across several significant changes in experimental design over each of the three studies. In addition, across experiments we often made arbitrary or incidental decisions regarding response window, response scale, trial number, target number, and manipulations of similarity. Despite these changes in experimental design, each of the three studies consistently revealed the same pattern of results: a positive linear relationship between reaction time and self–other discrepancy for similar but not dissimilar others. The strength and consistency of these results suggests that individuals indeed naturally and spontaneously recruit self-knowledge during social inferences about similar others and then correct away from such anchors using serial adjustment but do not do so for dissimilar others.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Social cognition research had previously identified the self as an important source of knowledge during social inferences. The current studies bear on existing knowledge about the role of the self in social cognition in number of ways. First, this study provides further support for simulation-based mentalizing theories, augmenting previous studies on egocentric biases. The current analysis technique provides explicit evidence for the self as the primary anchor during social inferences. Our dependent variable, self–other discrepancy, could only provide a meaningful measure of cognitive correction during social inferences if participants recruited self-knowledge during these inferences. If the self did not anchor social inferences, then self–other discrepancy would represent a psychologically meaningless construct and would not correspond to any behavioral measures or experimental manipulations. Instead, reaction time significantly predicted self–other discrepancy for similar others, and self–other discrepancy varied significantly as a function of similarity, thus suggesting that self-knowledge played a clear role in these social judgments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, this study supports the proposal that self-knowledge should be recruited only during social inferences about similar and not dissimilar targets. Research in social psychology has previously identified similarity as an important dimension in determining the strategy individuals will recruit when making social inferences (<a href="#c2">Ames, 2004a</a>, <a href="#c3">2004b</a>). These previous studies showed that the relative contribution of self to an inference increases when the target is similar to the participant; in contrast, the relative contribution of stereotype-based strategies increases when the target is dissimilar from the participant (and stereotype knowledge applies). Such results speak convincingly to the relative contribution of the self over stereotypes to social inferences. The current studies build upon these findings in that they also speak to the absolute contribution of the self to social inferences. Participants in these studies answered questions about the attitudes and opinions of others, none of which could be reliably answered on the basis of stereotypes, as no clear stereotype exists about items such as how much conservatives or liberals “enjoy going to the movies” or “prefer chocolate over vanilla ice cream.” Thus, perceivers could not avail themselves of a stereotype to make judgments about a dissimilar other. Nor was there a “correct” or “accurate” answer to any of these questions, as our targets were fictional. Thus, perceivers could not make use of individuating information or information about the true state of the world. In fact, participants did not have access to any reliable source of information that previous investigators have suggested people use during social inferences—except, of course, their own self-knowledge. In light of evidence that perceivers will invoke self-knowledge when other information is low (<a href="#c29">Ready, Clark, Watson, &amp; Westerhouse, 2000</a>), it is notable that in the current studies, participants did not judge dissimilar others on the basis of an egocentric anchor. Each of the three studies thus provides a strong demonstration of just how stridently individuals avoid using projection to judge dissimilar others, as the data consistently show an absolute absence of that strategy. As such, the current studies shed new light on the role of dissimilarity in inhibiting egocentrism in social inferences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Here we also expand upon the cognitive process by which self-knowledge influences social judgments. Specifically, we show that individuals will correct away from self-knowledge during social inferences about similar others using the process of serial adjustment. Previous research in judgment and decision making has identified the process of anchoring-and-adjustment as well suited to inferences with underdetermined answers (<a href="#c6">Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2001</a>; <a href="#c32">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974</a>). Indeed, previous behavioral research has used post hoc questions or explicit manipulations to suggest that anchoring-and-adjustment may underlie a number of social egocentric biases (<a href="#c8">Epley et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#c16">Gilovich et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#c17">Gilovich et al., 1998</a>). The current studies build upon these findings in a number of ways. First, the social inferences in this study differ importantly from previous work on anchoring-and-adjustment, where perceivers clearly knew which direction to adjust. In earlier studies, the anchor was always at the upper or lower boundary of possible responses, such that there was only one direction to move away from the anchor. In addition, particularly for studies on anchoring-and-adjustment in the social domain, participants clearly knew which direction to adjust, either because they knew that the target lacked information to which they alone were privy, or because there was a correct answer out there. Thus, in all these cases, perceivers experienced both a clear push away from the anchor and a clear pull toward the new judgment. However, the current study does not allow for this simple strategy: Participants lack an egocentric anchor at the upper or lower end of the response scale, and participants lack any more obviously correct answer toward which to adjust. Nevertheless, perceivers still spontaneously adopted an anchoring-and-adjustment strategy when attempting to infer the attitudes and opinions of (similar) others. It seems as if the egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment strategy is indeed robust to circumstances where there is no right answer toward which to adjust and where there is no extreme anchor from which to adjust.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, these studies use a novel method of measuring anchoring-and-adjustment, and this method provides a more naturalistic measure of how the process of adjustment unfolds. Previous investigators have used a number of different manipulations to determine whether an individual was using anchoring-and-adjustment: They have asked participants to respond under time pressure, or to respond while nodding or shaking their head; they have offered participants monetary incentives for accuracy (<a href="#c6">Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2001</a>; <a href="#c8">Epley et al., 2004</a>). All of these are clever means to see if inferences were accomplished via a serial process, as time pressure, nodding of the head, and low incentive for accuracy should all prematurely truncate the correction process. However, all of these manipulations, because they are indeed manipulations, alter the very process that they were designed to study. In contrast, the current studies avoided using any explicit manipulations of adjustment and instead captured the adjustment process as it unfolds in real time. Here, we tested for adjustment by looking for a linear relation between reaction time and self–other discrepancy. In tracking the process of serial adjustment as it transforms self-knowledge into an inference about others, here we find that this process is recruited only during inferences about similar and not dissimilar others.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, because these data are correlational, and because our measure of adjustment did not involve any manipulation, these findings on the relation between reaction time and self–other discrepancy certainly are open to other potential interpretations. For example, it is possible that instead of adjustment causally driving the relation between reaction time and self–other discrepancy, as we predicted, perceived differences between self and other on individual trials may instead drive longer reaction times. Nevertheless, although there are a number of potential alternative explanations for these data, we maintain that the most parsimonious explanation for these data is the one offered in the current article. Our interpretation does not require any additional theorizing to seem plausible, as it is derived from extant theory. Indeed, these data provide convergent evidence for the role of anchoring-and-adjustment in social inferences. Here we bring together research on cognitive mechanisms of inferences with research from social psychology to show that the circumstances under which individuals are most likely to anchor on self-knowledge—for similar but not dissimilar others—likewise determine when individuals will, or will not, invoke anchoring-and-adjustment during social inferences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The studies presented here consistently support the primary hypotheses that egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment underlies inferences about similar, but not dissimilar, others. However, these studies leave open many questions regarding the mechanisms for how people mentalize about dissimilar others, particularly when stereotypes provide no relevant information, as was the case in the current studies. These studies established the presence of anchoring-and-adjustment by only looking for evidence of adjustment, since adjustment from self implies the use of the self as an anchor. Thus, the lack of evidence here for adjustment from a self-knowledge anchor for dissimilar others could have resulted from one or more possible differences between the processes recruited to mentalize about similar and dissimilar others. For example, individuals may not recruit self-knowledge at all during inferences about dissimilar others. Alternatively, individuals may recruit self-knowledge but then immediately reject it as an invalid anchor, and thus the self does not anchor judgments. Finally, individuals may recruit self-knowledge, use self-knowledge to anchor judgments, but not use serial adjustment to correct away from this anchor. By design, the current studies tested specifically for the presence or absence of anchoring-and-adjustment and not for any of these more nuanced possibilities. In addition, they were not designed to test for numerous possible other mechanisms or anchors with which people may mentalize about dissimilar others. We can only conclude that people do not recruit the two-part process of egocentric anchoring followed by serial adjustment to make inferences about dissimilar others. Indeed, the mechanisms underlying inferences about dissimilar others, especially those for which stereotypes do not apply, remain underexplored. We look forward to future research that will help to identify the process by which people form inferences about dissimilar others.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current findings demonstrate two important features about the way in which we mentalize about other people. First, perceivers invoke their own experiences as a guide for inferring the experiences of another person. Perceivers flexibly recruit this self-knowledge depending on the likelihood that this knowledge will apply to the person in question. Second, in those cases where self-knowledge anchors social inferences, perceivers subsequently recruit the process of serial adjustment to correct for residual dissimilarities between self and other. Together, these findings shed light on both the cognitive mechanism for carrying out simulation-based mentalizing and the conditions under which it occurs.</p><a id="xge-142-1-151-ID0E0DB0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_130" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Allport, F.
