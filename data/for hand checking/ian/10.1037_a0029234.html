Tirpak earned his PhD in Counseling Psychology from Seton Hall University. He is currently a Postdoctoral Resident and Research Associate at University Counseling and Psychological Services (UCPS) at Lehigh University. His research focuses on professional training relationships in psychology, career development, and multicultural issues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Sandra S. Lee is a full professor, and former chair, department of professional psychology and family therapy at Seton Hall University. She earned a PhD from the New School for Social Research and a postdoctoral certificate in psychotherapy at the Greenwich Psychoanalytic Institute. Dr. Lee teaches two graduate courses in professional ethics and publishes and presents in this area.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Acknowledgement: </strong>We thank Sepideh Soheilian for her valuable comments on earlier drafts of this article.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recent literature has focused on ethical issues pertaining to competence for professional psychology graduate students (e.g., <a href="#c12">Forrest, Shen Miller, &amp; Elman, 2008</a>; <a href="#c19">Johnson et al., 2008</a>). In spite of this important focus, a paucity of information exists in regard to the ethical consideration of navigating boundaries and multiple relationships among graduate student peers. Given that professional psychology graduate students often take on several roles, it is beneficial to explore effective management of such relationships. Empirical data suggest that the student's negotiation of future ethical dilemmas may be partially contingent on management of earlier ethical dilemmas experienced during graduate training (<a href="#c10">Downs, 2003</a>). Thus, increasing awareness of, and aptly responding to boundary issues during graduate training may help to more effectively prepare students faced with similar dilemmas as practicing psychologists.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Understanding multiple relationships and boundaries is critical to successful navigation of professional peer relationships. According to Standard 3.05 of the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (<a href="#c1">American Psychological Association [APA], 2002</a>), a multiple relationship exists (a) when a psychologist is in a professional role with a person and at the same time is in another role with the same person; (b) when a psychologist is in a relationship with a person closely associated with the person with whom the psychologist has a professional relationship; and (c) when a psychologist promises to enter another relationship in the future with the person or a person closely related to the person with whom the psychologist has a preexisting relationship. This standard highlights that psychologists need to be aware of potential harmful effects of such multiple relationships on clients, therapists, the therapeutic relationship, or the profession of psychology. Furthermore, it is important to be aware that the standard outlines that not all multiple relationships are unethical, specifically those that would not reasonably be expected to cause impairment or risk exploitation or harm (APA).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Boundaries are important in the discussion of multiple relationships because they define the context and provide a framework for personal space and separation from others. Boundaries in professional psychology interventions, namely psychotherapy, are distinct from other relationships (e.g., familial, social, business). In particular, boundaries in psychotherapy typically encompass such factors as time and place, touch, self-disclosure, as well as the roles of gifts and payments (<a href="#c5">Barnett, Lazarus, Vasquez, Moorehead-Slaughter, &amp; Johnson, 2007</a>). Several scholars (e.g., <a href="#c22">Lazarus &amp; Zur, 2002</a>; <a href="#c34">Smith &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1995</a>) have categorized different types of both positive and negative boundary issues, namely boundary violations and boundary crossings. Specifically, a boundary crossing deviates from traditional limits in psychotherapy and has potential to benefit the client or therapeutic process, whereas a boundary violation goes beyond traditional limits in psychotherapy, but places the client or the therapeutic process at risk. For instance, a boundary crossing may involve having lunch with a client with an eating disorder, if done in a therapeutically appropriate manner, whereas a boundary violation may entail an exploitative or sexual relationship (<a href="#c22">Lazarus &amp; Zur, 2002</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Graduate students in professional psychology should strive to appropriately navigate the gray areas in the real contexts and situations in which they train, learn, and practice. Although all multiple relationships involve some form of boundary crossing, they do not always involve boundary violations. Correspondingly, it is advantageous to become more aware of the nuanced differences between exploitation and beneficence when it comes to the ethical issues that graduate students in professional psychology encounter and the multiple and overlapping relationships that can occur for them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Many different relationships exist between professional psychology graduate students and others, such as faculty, clients, supervisors, and peers within their program. The main purpose of this article is to explore and provide insight into the essentially uncharted area of graduate student peer-to-peer relationships. Related questions have been raised within the supervision literature concerning sexual attraction between a novice supervisor and his or her supervisee (e.g., <a href="#c11">Ellis &amp; Douce, 1994</a>), among doctoral and master's level students in counselor education programs (e.g., <a href="#c29">Scarborough et al., 2006</a>), with graduate assistants and practicum students in university counseling centers (e.g., <a href="#c9">Dallesasse, 2010</a>), and among clinical psychology student–faculty mentoring relationships (<a href="#c8">Clark, Harden, &amp; Johnson, 2000</a>). Graduate students must understand the ethics of multiple relationships and boundaries not only with clients, faculty, supervisors, and supervisees, but they should also consider how to navigate multiple relationships among their program peers. The purpose of this article is to examine graduate students in professional psychology, draw attention to ethical dilemmas across peer-to-peer multiple relationships, and explore recommendations for faculty and graduate students in professional psychology programs.</p><a id="tep-6-3-135-ID0EDBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_16" title="Graduate Students in Professional Psychology">Graduate Students in Professional Psychology</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Herein, we will provide contextual information about graduate students in professional psychology, with special consideration of their developmental journey throughout their training and education. Traditionally, novice students begin their program with relatively little power and few clinical and research skills. Graduate students in professional psychology often serve in roles that they may perceive as powerless or subservient (e.g., supervisee, student). <a href="#c33">Singh et al. (2010)</a> noted that doctoral trainees often hold minimal power devoid of active and supportive influence within their programs and the larger systems that compose the field (e.g., professional organizations). <a href="#c21">Layder (2009)</a> stated that, in all relationships, we aim to reduce uncertainty and unpredictability by drawing in support and mutual care from others. It is at this time that students are likely to seek out more advanced students to serve in the role as mentors to “learn the ropes” of their respective program.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As graduate students in professional psychology progress throughout their training and education, they begin to adopt an in-between status of both student and professional, which can be viewed on a developmental continuum. An implicit objective of training programs in professional psychology is to foster professional development with the goal to ultimately shift the graduate student's identity from student to professional. At the same time, however, graduate students in professional psychology may also take on roles with increased power and prestige over the course of their training (e.g., supervisor of other students, course instructor, researcher), while simultaneously remaining in roles that grant little power. Thus, this scenario elicits a fluid power differential based on their transitory position of power and progression in the program.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Concerning professional psychology graduate students' fluidity of power, their specific role may regularly fluctuate. For example, students may fill the roles of student, teaching assistant, instructor, supervisor, supervisee, counselor, group counselor, mentor, mentee, advisee, coauthor, research partner, classmate, and peer all over the course of one day. Within the counselor education literature, <a href="#c29">Scarborough et al. (2006)</a> noted that doctoral students are involved with several roles, often with little direction and guidance about the potential hazards of their roles and positions. Not only can the lack of knowledge about the influence of one's role be confusing but also the lack of direction, feedback, or structure may be a difficult adjustment for many students. In fact, a lack of structure and feedback has been found to lead to increased distress for students (e.g., <a href="#c3">Baird, 1969</a>; <a href="#c18">Hartnett, 1976</a>; <a href="#c28">Quick, Murphy, Hurrell, &amp; Orman, 1992</a>). In terms of gender differences, <a href="#c23">Mallinckrodt and Leong (1992)</a> have found female graduate students to experience greater role strain than their male counterparts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The variety of roles for professional psychology graduate students may create difficulties and obstacles for some students. In fact, graduate students report to experience isolation and distress due to the expectations and requirements of their graduate training and education (<a href="#c24">Oberlander &amp; Barnett, 2005</a>). The responsibilities of the graduate student commitment may include changes in lifestyle, such as a decrease in income, and an increase in academic responsibilities (e.g., research, clinical work, field work). As a result of the demands of graduate training, personal relationships may suffer, and/or the graduate students may be more vulnerable to symptoms of burn-out, particularly with a lack of supportive systems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In light of some of the challenges professional psychology graduate students face, it is foreseeable for students to gravitate toward one another for support, and to become acquaintances, colleagues, and even friends during the course of their training and education (<a href="#c13">Gibson, 2005</a>). Although friendship is typically perceived as a reciprocal relationship, ties are not always symmetrical (<a href="#c25">Olk &amp; Gibbons, 2010</a>). In other words, peers within professional psychology graduate programs may have different perceptions about their peer relationships. For example, graduate student A may perceive graduate student B as a colleague within the department, whereas graduate student B may perceive graduate student A as a close friend. Nevertheless, opportunities for socialization exist among students with similar interests, values, personality, and skills within professional psychology programs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In due course, graduate students in professional psychology programs may be engaged in shared clinical training experiences, such as the same practicum placement or graduate assistantship. Furthermore, numerous responsibilities both academically and across training settings allow for the opportunity for students to collaborate their efforts in a variety of environments (e.g., study sessions, outreach programming, research collaboration). Thus, the frequent exposure for peers in professional psychology programs allow for vast opportunities for students to develop intersecting relationships over the course of their training and education. These relationships may vary in whether they are perceived positively or negatively.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Throughout one's training and education in professional psychology, advanced graduate students are continually called on by more novice students for informal mentoring and guidance. Specifically in regard to ethical dilemmas, advanced students are often on the “front line” to assist more novice students, especially in times when it may be difficult or thorny for students to approach a faculty member or supervisor. One other reason novice students may be quick to call on advanced students is to inquire whether an advanced student has previously faced a similar ethical scenario during the course of his or her tenure. In other words, graduate students in professional psychology may see if a “tried and true” method to handle certain peer-to-peer multiple relationships already exists.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The notion that advanced graduate students in professional psychology programs are looked on to model ethical behavior is an area that has received far too little attention. Literature on the topic is scarce, however, <a href="#c35">Thomas (2010)</a> has touched on this phenomenon in noting the degree to which supervisees perceive themselves to be like, or aspire to be like their supervisors. Thomas noted that supervisors and supervisees may share similarities both professionally (e.g., similar theoretical orientation, preferred client populations) as well as personally (e.g., love for the same sport, similar political views). Thomas asserted that when supervisees feel admiration for their supervisors and therefore identify with them, they are more likely to emulate them. Conversely, if cultural factors and personal characteristics align in an alternate way, the relative power of the supervisor may be diminished.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Graduate students within professional psychology programs have the potential to differ on several multicultural dimensions, including but not limited to the following: advancement in their program, age, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability status, religion, and socioeconomic status. Differences in levels of privilege and oppression within peer-to-peer relationships may further complicate the relationship and introduce varying levels of power and privilege, or lack thereof, into the peer relationship. For instance, minority status students in some rural areas may have limited opportunities to interact with other minority status individuals beyond the context of their professional graduate program. Moreover, <a href="#c14">Gilbert and Rossman (1992)</a> have found that minority status students have fewer available mentors from ethically similar backgrounds. To discuss each potential dyad is beyond the scope of this article; however, it is important to be aware of minority status among professional psychology graduate students and its level of salience and impact on the peer-to-peer relationship.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Graduate programs in professional psychology's failure to adequately prepare students to manage these multiple roles, and the expectations of their graduate student journey can create increasing difficulty for students. Because graduate students continue to be influenced by their peers, who ultimately influence future cohorts of students, it is prudent to better understand possible ethical dilemmas that may arise among peer-to-peer multiple relationships. Understanding and appropriately addressing peer-to-peer multiple relationships in professional psychology is crucial to ensure the welfare of all and the future of professional psychology.</p><a id="tep-6-3-135-ID0ECBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_29" title="Ethical Dilemmas Among Peer-to-Peer Multiple Relationships in Professional Psychology">Ethical Dilemmas Among Peer-to-Peer Multiple Relationships in Professional Psychology</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c26">Pearson and Piazza (1997)</a> developed a classification system of multiple relationships to aid in recognizing existing relationships and predict when they are likely to develop. According to their system, five categories exist: (a) <em>circumstantial multiple roles</em>, (b) <em>structured multiple professional roles</em>, (c) <em>shifts in professional roles</em>, (d) <em>personal and professional role conflicts</em>, and (e) <em>predatory professionals</em>. A circumstantial multiple role is one that emerges out of random chance, whereas a structured multiple professional role ensues based on part of an individual's professional job or academic responsibilities. A shift in professional roles develops based on a modification of roles, and a personal and professional role conflict involves a boundary crossing of personal and professional roles. Last, a predatory professional involves a scenario when a practitioner, in a position of power, exploits another individual to meet his or her personal needs (<a href="#c26">Pearson &amp; Piazza, 1997</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A variety of ethical dilemmas may surface among peer relationships in graduate programs in professional psychology. For the purpose of this article, three real-life scenarios, with de-identified information, are described. The following examples highlight the probable and complicated situations that occur within professional psychology programs, which may or may not be discussed in the larger context with a supervisor, faculty advisor, or other students.
<br /><ol type="1"><li>Mary, an advanced professional psychology doctoral student is a teaching assistant for an advanced counseling skills course composed of several master's level students. Mary is also completing a social psychology course, which contains some members of the class she is teaching (i.e., circumstantial multiple role). In Mary's social psychology course, she recently learns that she will be part of a group project with three master's level students from the course she is teaching. This situation has potential to elicit role ambiguity and uncertainty for all involved students, as it may be unclear which boundaries and expectations are operating during interactions both inside and outside of the classroom environment. Mary now takes on the role of instructor, colleague, and possibly peer with several students that view her to be in a position of power from an earlier established role. The master's level students also experience the multiple relationships, such that, their instructor is also considered to be a communal partner on a project together.</li></ol></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To understand this scenario, it is important to review the faculty–student literature. <a href="#c27">Plaut (1993)</a> asserted that the teacher–student relationship in graduate school is unique because of the collegiality and social interaction that is likely to occur. In fact, scholars note that it is often the informal interactions between faculty and students that may have the greatest impact on the student's professional development (<a href="#c30">Schlosser &amp; Gelso, 2001</a>, <a href="#c31">2005</a>; <a href="#c32">Schlosser, Knox, Moskovitz, &amp; Hill, 2003</a>). Thus, it is important to consider the informality likely to occur between Mary and the other students and how this affects their multiple relationships. Within this example, it would be beneficial if Mary were to assess whether additional multiple relationships were necessary, or harmful in any way, and how the involved parties (e.g., group members) feel about their multiple roles. This example provides a good example of how a boundary crossing may have potential to benefit the parties involved and not cause harm.
<br /><ul><li>2. Hector, a professional psychology graduate student, learns that his good friend from college, Henry, was accepted into the same psychology program and about to enter his first year in the program. Hector has already been a part of his program for 4 years. A once evenhanded, congenial relationship now transforms into a situation where the advanced student, Hector, is automatically placed in a position of power (i.e., shift in professional role) because of his status in the program. Hector may be looked upon as a role model or mentor from Henry's perspective, despite that they were once on a similar level in regard to their mutual friendship.</li></ul></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this example, a once mutual friendship turned into what <a href="#c26">Pearson and Piazza (1997)</a> would refer to as a shift in professional roles. Thus, a once impartial relationship now transforms to a situation where the advanced doctoral student is automatically in a position of power (greater experience in the program). As a fourth-year doctoral student, Hector has presumably navigated his way through the professional psychology program (e.g., completed courses, presented at conferences, defended dissertation, is in the process of preparing for the internship application process) and may be perceived as a role model from Henry's point of view. Both students ought to prepare for how this scenario is likely to affect their relationship as friends and peers within and outside of the program due to the power differential. Within this example, it would be prudent for the advanced doctoral student to acknowledge, discuss, and manage this shift in power, as this situation may result in role confusion for the incoming student, the advanced doctoral student, or both, in navigating future encounters both inside and outside of the psychology program. For example, if Henry attends social events with Hector and other fourth-year students, Henry's first-year cohort members may begin to feel excluded if they are not invited to the same social gatherings of other advanced students. This example not only highlights how peer-to-peer relationships can easily translate into a mentor–mentee relationship but also how the multiple relationships may create other complicated circumstances.
<br /><ul><li>3. Latacha, a fourth-year doctoral student, is scheduled to provide peer supervision to Marissa, a first-year doctoral student in the same program. The two students are also on the same research team and have had several formal and informal exchanges during the course of the year (i.e., personal and professional role conflict). Examples of these interactions include sharing a class together, working at the same practicum setting, and being a part of the psychology program's multicultural planning committee. Latacha is now in a position to evaluate Marissa, while at the same time attempting to find a sense of balance in relation to her multiple relationships with Marissa.</li></ul></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This final example highlights the role of supervision among graduate training in professional psychology. The experience of providing supervision, or being trained as a supervisor, is unique and creates a significant shift in power whereby students are now in a position to evaluate others. Any previous or imminent relationship with other students-turned supervisees now creates omnipresent multiple relationships whereby the advanced doctoral student is now not only in a position of power but also an authority figure with an expectation to evaluate the supervisee. Often the novel role as a supervisor is one of the first times when students will acquire a substantial amount of power in their training and education, aside from becoming counselors and teaching assistants. Subsequently, students are often underprepared in the understanding and implications of their newly acquired role. In this example, it is the responsibility of the supervisor (i.e., Latacha) to maintain appropriate boundaries in the relationship. It is suggested that Latacha and Marissa openly discuss their thoughts and feelings in regard to the multiple relationships in supervision, which ought to be initiated by the supervisor.</p><a id="tep-6-3-135-ID0EBBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_37" title="Recommendations for Faculty and Graduate Students in Professional Psychology Programs">Recommendations for Faculty and Graduate Students in Professional Psychology Programs</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We agree with the assertion by <a href="#c15">Gottlieb, Handlesman, and Knapp (2008)</a>: Educating oneself about ethics should be a lifelong process. Graduate students and trainees are provided with ongoing, experiential, and supportive educational environments and activities for ethics education throughout their training. Building an environment of ethical awareness should be incorporated and frequently highlighted within graduate students' professional psychology training program. Thus, the following section outlined a set of recommendations intended for both faculty–training programs and graduate students in professional psychology programs. A range of key topics (i.e., informed consent, program structure, orientation, and curriculum) are highlighted in the chronological order students would likely experience them throughout their training with regard to navigating peer-to-peer multiple relationships.</p><a id="tep-6-3-135-ID0EDBBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Informed Consent</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We recommend that a major objective for training programs in professional psychology should be aimed at gaining awareness of the roles and imminent positions of power that a graduate student in professional psychology may assume. Incoming students should receive advanced information and informed consent regarding their roles, and the positions of power that they will have in relation to others (specifically including peers) throughout the course of their training. For example, many doctoral students are not aware that they will be faced with evaluative responsibilities prior to receiving their degree (<a href="#c29">Scarborough et al., 2006</a>). Thus, having this knowledge beforehand will better assist graduate students in professional psychology in preparation of managing boundaries prior to engaging in multiple relationships. For example, if students are aware that they will be supervising incoming students, they may be proactive in their negotiation of close personal relationships with other graduate students. This is not to say that social relationships among graduate students should automatically be avoided; rather an acknowledgment should be made of where and when multiple relationships are likely to occur in training to help students more effectively navigate potential ethical challenges.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another important recommendation for graduate students is to acknowledge the power and the responsibilities of their roles. Students may vary on several levels, including comfort in engaging in a discussion concerning multiple roles, multicultural competence, and ethical awareness and insight. Making others aware of all multiple roles that a professional psychology graduate student is engaged in on campus is strongly recommended. For example, a graduate assistant at the university career center simultaneously engaged as a practicum student at the same university counseling center, and as an instructor within the university, should announce his or her multiple positions during interactions with peers, clients, and students. This initial disclaimer and continual disclosure informs individuals of the graduate student's multiple roles; better prepares them if they are to engage in a multiple relationship; and reduces the likelihood of unforeseen, startling multiple relationships. This proclamation also makes others well aware of steps they can take to avoid multiple relationships, particularly if the relationship has the potential to be harmful in any way.</p><a id="tep-6-3-135-ID0ECBBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Program Structure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Specific to navigating peer-to-peer multiple relationships in professional psychology, departments may benefit from setting up a formalized peer-mentoring program. Advanced students can take on the responsibility to mentor new students in the program to assist with orienting them and serving as a resource throughout their training and education. As previously mentioned, advanced students are often looked to model ethical behavior based on their associated power within their program in comparison to novice students. Poor management of boundaries and multiple relationships from an advanced student may, in turn, negatively influence a novice student's future ethical decision-making process. Likewise, a positive experience may have a prosocial effect on the future management of the beginning students' navigation of boundaries and multiple relationships. Having a formalized mentoring program creates potential for a more comfortable environment for novice students to easily approach more advanced students without fear or concern of inconveniencing the advanced student.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is advised that advanced students be aware of the role that they play and their potential to be viewed as prospective mentors to novice students during the course of their training and education. If possible, it is recommended that the mentor–mentee relationship be a distinct relationship and not interfere with additional multiple relationships (e.g., student–teacher, supervisor–supervisee). A carefully formulated mentoring program may be able to assign mentees to mentors that have a lower likelihood of developing problematic multiple relationships. It is assumed but not necessarily always the case that the advanced student may have more experience and training in negotiating and effectively navigating these important dialogues. However, it is also possible that this may not have been a topic of preparation among the students' graduate training program. Consequently, it is the responsibility of the training program to adequately prepare students for navigating peer-to-peer multiple relationships in professional psychology programs.</p><a id="tep-6-3-135-ID0EBBBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Orientation</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#c29">Scarborough et al. (2006)</a> suggested that one possible approach to manage boundaries in peer-to-peer relationships among graduate students is to create an orientation session to outline and discuss possible ethical dilemmas within a safe context. This orientation can be led by program faculty. It can also be facilitated by advanced students in the program, to model ethical behavior and to reflect on the unique ethical peer-to-peer challenges of the students' respective program. During this orientation, the use of role play or a peer-to-peer multiple relationships skit may assist graduate students in acquiring an understanding of their future roles, as well as possible approaches for navigating them. It is also recommended that there be opportunities for live feedback from peers and faculty members to encourage consultation and collaboration when making ethical decisions. Implementing an orientation for managing peer-to-peer multiple relationships upon entry into a professional psychology graduate program has the potential to cultivate an environment of learning, security, and communication, which are all important ingredients for professional psychology.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Within the orientation and across the training program, it is critical that a supportive and safe environment is fostered so that topics can be introduced and explored freely and thoroughly. Such an environment not only encourages incoming students but also reinforces continual education for both advanced students and faculty. To create a supportive environment, diverse opinions and perspectives must be openly discussed. For instance, <a href="#c6">Barretti and Beitin (2010)</a> discussed the importance of students in training being able to safely discuss their biases and to depict their values so that they can be properly acknowledged. <a href="#c17">Hansen and Goldberg (1999)</a> also highlighted the importance of merging personal values in conjunction with the professional ethics codes for ethical decision making. Therefore, a discussion of salient personal values and cultural values may be useful during a peer-to-peer multiple relationships orientation. Cultural differences surrounding this topic may generate rich diversity and a more comprehensive understanding of the personal lens in which graduate students in psychology view the world. Such a discussion is imperative to begin an awareness, sensitivity, and understanding of different values en route to striving for multicultural competence. An honest discussion within a supportive environment possesses a strong likelihood for team building as well as cultural understanding and mutual respect.</p><a id="tep-6-3-135-ID0EABBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Curriculum</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Training programs may also begin to more actively infuse ethical dilemmas and potential peer-to-peer challenges within their curriculum (e.g., ethics courses). Possible assignments may include written assignments or class discussions about students' preexisting expectations concerning ethics, values, and their willingness to adopt a new set of values and traditions regarding peer-to-peer relationships and issues of power. Use of an “ethics autobiography” (cited in <a href="#c7">Bashe, Anderson, Handelsman, &amp; Klevansky, 2007</a>; <a href="#c16">Handelsman, Gottlieb, &amp; Knapp, 2005</a>) may assist to generate appreciation and recognition of students' values and the moral and professional orientation of their culture. Discussion of students' ethics autobiography in class provides rich information for how students may align with, or have differing opinions on, managing peer-to-peer multiple relationships. Students may also work in small groups or pairs to present on the peer-to-peer ethical dilemmas they have encountered or expect to encounter throughout their training. This scenario helps to normalize the presence of peer-to-peer multiple relationships, as well as provides an opportunity for consultation and collaboration to discuss different ways to manage ethical dilemmas.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, an infusion of students' multicultural dimensions, backgrounds, values, and traditions highlight the importance of diversity and how issues of diversity may impact navigating peer-to-peer multiple relationships. Consider an example of an advanced student that claimed primary authorship beforehand for a conference poster but did not contribute significantly in comparison to novice students on his or her research team. Not only is the dimension of “progression in the program” at play, but it is also critical to consider additional concepts of power, privilege, discrimination, and oppression, and how the interplay of these cultural dynamics may influence the management of peer-to-peer multiple relationships in professional psychology. Ethical guidelines (e.g., APA Ethical Standard 8.12) are relatively clear in regard to publication authorship, yet the peer-to-peer relationship entered into the decision making on poster authorship in the following example.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Having students assess, evaluate, or debate the APA Ethics Code (e.g., <a href="#c20">Keith-Spiegel, 1994</a>) also may be an effective way to contrast principles and move students toward integration of the APA code with their personal values, specifically with respect to peer-to-peer relationships. These exercises may bring ethics to more of the forefront of graduate students' minds as well as adopt more of a “both/and” approach in comparison to an “either/or” approach. Students may also benefit from examining peer-to-peer multiple relationships in professional psychology by engaging in experiential exercises where they role play different multiple relationships, and their peers can comment on or debate how they might differ in handling certain ethical dilemmas. The more practice and preparation of managing peer-to-peer multiples relationships in the classroom will likely improve students' ability to respond appropriately when situations arise in the future.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to <a href="#c4">Barnett (2008)</a>, an all-or-nothing approach to multiple relationships should be avoided. Instead, it is recommended that in addition to consulting with the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (APA), individuals should also consult laws and regulations as well as reflect on their own professional judgment and conscience when making ethical decisions. For graduate students in professional psychology, it is encouraged that students continually invest time in exploring and understanding their personal values as well as consult with peers, supervisors, and faculty, and advisors.</p><a id="tep-6-3-135-ID0EABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_59" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The context of the peer-to-peer relationship should be at the forefront of a graduate student in professional psychology's ethical decision-making process. Professional psychology graduate students should always consider ethical dilemmas from multiple perspectives and examine who the multiple relationships are expected to benefit most and if any potential harm or exploitation is present. It is strongly recommended that faculty instructors in professional psychology educate current graduate students in the complexities of peer-to-peer multiple relationships. The more informed that graduate students are about such issues, the better prepared they will be to deal with them when they occur. In addition, graduate students should be encouraged to seek consultation and supervision when peer-to-peer multiple relationships exist. It is important to recall that not all peer-to-peer multiple relationships are harmful, and some have potential to generate great benefits.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Ongoing efforts to investigate and better understand specific ethical issues among professional psychology graduate students in psychology are warranted. Of primary importance, it is essential for future researchers to investigate whether there is a gap among professional psychology graduate students' stated values (i.e., espoused values) and what values they actually exhibit (i.e., enacted values) in regard to navigating peer-to-peer multiple relationships within professional psychology graduate programs. The area of peer-to-peer multiple relationships in professional psychology is an important area that would benefit from increased attention and scholarship.</p><a id="tep-6-3-135-ID0E0DB0AAAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_64" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">American Psychological Association.
