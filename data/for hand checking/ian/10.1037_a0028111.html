/><em>Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University</em>;</div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Acknowledgement: </strong>I am grateful to Carolyn Roux and Jacques Nantel for the rating data presented in the Applications section of this article.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A key challenge in quantitative psychology is to develop models that parsimoniously capture how individuals differ in arriving at their judgments or choices. Successful examples include item response and discrete choice models (<a href="#c7">Böckenholt, 2006</a>; <a href="#c49">van der Linden &amp; Hambleton, 1997</a>). Both classes of models have in common that they postulate a single response process that leads to the observed judgments and choices. In item response models, the probability of a correct response to an item depends on the difference between the test taker's ability and the item difficulty. In choice models, the probability of a choice depends on the differences in utility between the choice options. Thus, in both cases, a single response process, formalized as a difference between ability and difficulty for item response models or as a difference between utilities for choice models, is postulated to hold for all respondents. In this article, I go beyond the notion of a single response process and consider applications in which respondents may arrive at their answers via multiple response processes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Multiple response processes abound in psychological research. For example, there are a considerable number of dual-response theories in judgment and choice applications that are based on System 1 and System 2 distinctions (<a href="#c13">Evans, 2008</a>). System 1 processes are characterized as unconscious, rapid, effortless, and automatic, whereas System 2 processes are characterized as conscious, slow, effortful, and deliberative. Each system can lead to different answers, as illustrated by the following test item: “A bat and a ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?” (<a href="#c14">Frederick, 2005</a>, p. 26). A typical immediate answer is “10 cents” because $1.10 can be divided easily into $1 and 10 cents, and 10 cents seems to be a reasonable price for a ball. However, after a moment of reflection and deliberation, a respondent may realize that the difference between $1 and 10 cents is less than $1 and give the correct answer instead.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Similarly, when asked questions about personal or sensitive issues, respondents may want to give honest answers but also want to present themselves in a favorable light, with the result that items measure both the actual behaviors of the respondents as well as the respondents' tendency to edit their responses. To identify which response process gives rise to the observed answer, social desirability scales (<a href="#c27">Paulhus, 1984</a>) have been developed that measure the degree to which respondents tend to present themselves favorably. However, success in using these scales to correct for respondents' response-editing behavior has been limited so far (<a href="#c41">Steenkamp, De Jong, &amp; Baumgartner, 2010</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In a choice task, decision makers may differ in their sensitivity to contextual cues (e.g., whether an option is a compromise among the available options) and their preferences for the presented attributes of the choice options. Some decision makers may base their choice on the basis of contextual cues only, whereas others may focus on the observed attributes of the choice options. Systematic violations of random utility theories are observed when these different ways of choosing among the available options are not taken into account (<a href="#c47">Tsetsos, Usher, &amp; Chater, 2010</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Allowing for multiple response processes may also lead to more valid conclusions about both item characteristics and drivers of individual differences. For example, in the previously mentioned dual-process application, experimental treatments (e.g., the readability of the choice material; <a href="#c1">Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley, &amp; Eyre, 2007</a>) may affect System 1 but not System 2 processes. Survey methods (e.g., whether the interview is conducted face to face or via an online questionnaire) may affect the degree to which respondents edit their responses but not the actual behavior under study. Also, motivational states may moderate attention to contextual cues but not the attention toward the options' attributes (<a href="#c24">Mourali, Böckenholt, &amp; Laroche, 2007</a>). Thus, in all of these cases, relating covariates to the hypothesized response processes or direct experimental manipulations of the response subprocesses can prove critical for understanding the determinants of the responses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this article, I focus on multiple response processes in judgment and choice applications that can be represented via a tree structure. The emphasis on nested response processes is motivated not only by the reported applications but also by the consideration that this class of multiple response models can be fit with standard software programs for item response models that allow for missing data. Specifically, I show that Mplus (<a href="#c25">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998–2010</a>) is well suited for estimating tree-based response models with process-specific covariates.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The proposed approach belongs to the class of latent response models (<a href="#c22">Maris, 1995</a>) because the observed response is viewed as a result of multiple latent responses.

Here the first response process (denoted by <em>I</em>) yields the outcome A with probability Pr<em>j</em>(θ<em>i</em><sup>(<em>I</em>)</sup>). With the complementary probability 1 − Pr<em>j</em>(θ<em>i</em><sup>(<em>I</em>)</sup>) the second response process is activated, which yields the outcome B with probability Pr<em>j</em>(θi<sup>(<em>II</em>)</sup>) and C with complementary probability 1 − Pr<em>j</em>(θi<sup>(<em>II</em>)</sup>). Note that there are two person-specific parameters, θ<em>i</em><sup>(I)</sup> and θ<em>i</em><sup>(II)</sup>, that describe individual differences captured by the two pseudoitems. The Roman letters <em>I</em> and <em>II</em> are used to emphasize the order of the two subprocesses. Thus, B or C can be observed only after the first response process is concluded.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The notion of two nested subprocesses captures the intuitive-deliberate distinction described in the introduction. When contemplating the question about the cost for a ball, a respondent may arrive initially at the intuitive response of 10 cents on the basis of System 1 processing. This response is the final answer if the respondent does not have sufficient inhibitory control to engage in systematic, effortful thought to override this response. However, if inhibitory control is available to suppress the System 1 response, deliberate processing can revise the intuitive response and arrive at the correct answer, provided no algorithmic or other calculation errors are committed. Thus, in this case, A refers to the intuitive response, B refers to incorrect responses based on deliberate reasoning, and C refers to the correct response. The first response process (I) captures ability differences in inhibitory control (<a href="#c21">Logan, Schachar, &amp; Tannock, 1997</a>) and the second response process (II) captures ability differences in deliberate reasoning (<a href="#c8">Böckenholt, 2012</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the Applications section of this article, I apply a similar set-up to disentangle the effects of contextual and attribute-based information in choice. Here the three response categories correspond to different choice options that vary on two negatively correlated attributes (e.g., price and quality). Options A and C score high on one of the two attributes, whereas Option B can be viewed as a compromise by taking on intermediate values on both attributes. The tree model in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> illustrates that decision makers may first consider contextual information and decide whether to pick the compromise option, B. If the compromise is not picked, then, as a next step, they choose between Options A and C on the basis of the preferred attribute.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Extensions to items with more than three response categories allow for more complex tree structures. <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> shows a three-process scenario for an item with five response categories. Process I leads either to the selection of Response Category C or to the activation of Process II, which, in turn, activates Process III. The latter process yields the outcomes A and B or D and E. In the Applications section, I report an example for such subprocesses that captures how a person may answer an attitudinal item with the response categories <em>strongly disagree, disagree, neither disagree or agree, agree</em>, and <em>strongly agree</em>. Here we assume that respondents first decide whether to express an opinion or not express an opinion (which corresponds to the middle category, C). At the next steps, we assume that respondents decide on the direction of their attitudes and, finally, on the intensity of their attitudes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In sum, each polytomous item can be represented by multiple nested processes that give rise to the selection of one of the response categories. To facilitate the estimation of multiple response models, I introduce the restriction that each observed response category has a unique path to one of the latent response processes. Thus, scenarios under which the same response category may be arrived at via different latent processes are not considered. For example, this restriction excludes testing applications in which respondents may give a correct answer to a test item on the basis of reasoning or guessing. Although I acknowledge that because of this limitation, I do not provide a complete solution to the modeling of multiple latent response processes, it is worth stressing that the considered class of latent response models is of much use in applied work.</p><a id="met-17-4-665-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Pseudoitems</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For the estimation of the multiple response models, the outcomes of each response process are represented by pseudoitems.

Specifically, Response A is obtained when the first pseudoitem takes on the value 0 and a missing value by design is obtained for the second pseudoitem. Response B is observed when the first and second pseudoitems take on the values 1 and 0, respectively. And Response C is obtained when both the first and second pseudoitems take on the value 1.

A DIF analysis addresses the question of whether an item performs differently across subgroups of a population (e.g., different age groups) or across contexts (e.g., the position of an item in different item sequences). For example, using DIF methods (<a href="#c42">Steinberg, 1994</a>, <a href="#c43">2001</a>) showed that the serial position of an item in a questionnaire and the pairing of questions in a vignette can affect the parameters of the graded response models. This experimental approach in detecting DIF can provide important insights about both the causes that lead to DIF and the underlying response process. In contrast, the approach presented here is more descriptive because possible sources of DIF are built into the hypothesized response structure. For example, if DIF is a result of respondents differing in their preference for selecting the <em>neither disagree or agree</em> category, then this behavior can be diagnosed and easily interpreted using a two-process model as shown in the next section. Moreover, preferences for the middle categories can also be related to covariates to explain this phenomenon. Both features make the multiprocess approach a useful addition to the current toolbox of DIF methods.</p><a id="met-17-4-665-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Estimation</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The presented multiple-process models can be estimated with latent-variable software programs that allow for missing responses.

Thus, each item is coded into two or more pseudoitems depending on the postulated tree structure. These pseudoitems are then modeled using the one-parameter probit or other item response models.

For example, some respondents may avoid using extreme response categories even if they feel strongly about a topic. Other respondents may tend to select extreme response categories. Predictors of these behaviors include ambivalence avoidance, rigidity, and certainty (<a href="#c12">De Jong, Steenkamp, Fox, &amp; Baumgartner, 2008</a>). It is important to note that response style effects have been shown to induce spurious correlations among otherwise unrelated constructs (<a href="#c5">Baumgartner &amp; Steenkamp, 2001</a>; <a href="#c9">Chun, Campbell, &amp; Yoo, 1974</a>; <a href="#c17">Hui &amp; Triandis, 1985</a>). To overcome this problem, data from Likert scales are sometimes reduced to the binary level by combining all <em>agree</em> and <em>disagree</em> responses into two categories: <em>accept</em> and <em>reject</em>. However, collapsing weak and strong responses is not desirable because potentially valuable information about the intensity of attitudes is lost.

The latter covariate was measured on a 7-point scale ranging from elementary school to doctorate degree.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These items were selected for two reasons. First, they are similar in the sense that they assess whether people value ethical firms. However, they also differ in one respect. In the first question, respondents are asked to think about positive ethical behavior of a firm, whereas in the second question, respondents are asked to consider unethical behavior of a firm. However, this difference is subtle, and one may conjecture that overall both questions may yield similar answers. Second, in both questions, the importance of ethical behavior is negated, which complicates the thought process (<a href="#c46">Tourangeau, Rips, &amp; Rasinski, 2000</a>) and may trigger a respondent to select the midpoint of the scale. Some initial support for these observations is provided by a visual inspection of <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>. Approximately 20% (259) of the 1,287 respondents selected the same response category for both items. The modal response for both items is the midpoint of the scale, indicating that a substantial number of respondents choose to neither disagree nor agree with the two items.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The last three columns in <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a> contain the predicted frequencies of three models fitted to the data. The last row contains the corresponding log-likelihood ratio (LR) statistics, obtained by comparing observed and predicted frequencies for each model. The first (single-process) model is the graded-response model, which requires the estimation of 10 parameters (one item location, three threshold parameters, as well as the variance of the person parameter for each item). This model yields a poor fit of the data. Specifically, this model does not capture the strong agreement between both items and predicts a less frequent selection of the scale midpoint than is observed in the data. The second (two-process) model allows for the possibility that respondents may first decide whether they feel strongly about the issue. This model requires the estimation of two additional parameters for each item, capturing the degree to which an item triggers indifference. The fit improvement is considerable compared with the graded-response model, but the absolute model fit is still poor, with <em>LR</em> = 296.5 and 11 degrees of freedom. As expected, the two-process model does well at predicting the selection of the midpoint for both items. However, it does not improve substantially on the prediction of other cells compared with the graded response model. In contrast, the third (three-process) model performs satisfactorily for the data (<em>LR</em> = 16 with 12 degrees of freedom). It captures both the agreement as well as the disagreement between the two ratings. From these results, we can conclude that respondents differ in their degree of involvement, in their attitudinal direction, and in the intensity expression of their attitude. All three subprocesses matter in obtaining a satisfactory description of the data.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a href="#tbl4">Table 4</a> displays the item parameter estimates of the three-process model for both items and the random effects (see also the online supplemental materials).

A simplified model with γ1<sup>(<em>I</em>)</sup> = γ2<sup>(<em>I</em>)</sup> and γ1<sup>(<em>III</em>)</sup> = γ2<sup>(<em>III</em>)</sup> yields a difference LR test of 3.8 on 2 degrees of freedom. Thus, the items differ only in the extent to which they trigger a directional response. The second item focusing on unethical behavior triggers a more negative attitudinal response than does the first item, which emphasizes the ethical behavior of a firm.

The effects of age are difficult to predict because of two opposing mechanisms. On the one hand, one may conjecture that younger people are more aware of (un)ethical behaviors of firms and are thus more concerned about this issue in their purchase decisions. On the other hand, younger people typically are in a more fragile financial position, which makes extra expenditures for ethically produced products more burdensome. One strategy to cope with this dilemma is to discount unethical firm behaviors. Both mechanisms—greater awareness and greater discounting—can cancel each other, with the result that age may not have a strong predictive effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast to age, education has been shown to be predictive of ethical consumption (<a href="#c40">Starr, 2009</a>). One potential explanation for this finding is that education promotes both thinking about and acting in favor of the public good (<a href="#c26">Nie, Junn, &amp; Stehlik-Berry, 1996</a>). In my analysis of the effects of age and education, I included both mean-centered covariates at each subprocess level and thus estimated six parameters.

Age accounts significantly for variation in the intensity subprocess. Older respondents tend to use the <em>strongly</em> response category more often than younger respondents do. However, no significant age effect is observed for the indifference or the direction decision. Thus, age seems to be related predominantly to scale usage—older respondents are less likely to report being unsure—and not to the attitudinal position of the respondents on ethical consumption. The scale-usage effect of age is consistent with a recent study by <a href="#c39">Soubelet and Salthouse (2011)</a>, who found an age-related increase in social desirability. Thus, an interesting follow-up hypothesis is that older respondents tend to be more extreme in their responses on business ethics because they are more prone to give socially desirable responses.<br /><br /><a id="tbl5"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/90f7fe2f4c64e8b850ae4bb01cf231ad/571cc320/pdh/met/met-17-4-665-tbl5a.gif" alt="met-17-4-665-tbl5a.gif" title="Regression Effects of the Three-Process Model" /><em>Regression Effects of the Three-Process Model</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast to age, education appears to have a strong effect on the indifference and direction subprocesses.

Models based on a smaller number of response processes did not provide a good fit with the data. Although not discussed in detail, the inclusion of the covariates age and education pointed to DIF and significantly improved the relative fit of the one- and two-process models; however, the absolute fit of these models remained poor.

These authors conceptualized choice goals in terms of <a href="#c51">Higgins's (1997)</a> regulatory focus theory, which classifies them into two broad categories: ideals and oughts. Ideals denote aspirations, hopes, and wishes, whereas oughts stand for responsibilities, obligations, and duties. Higgins's theory posits that ideals and oughts entail distinct self-regulatory systems. Regulation in relation to ideals involves a promotion focus, which is a regulatory state concerned with advancement and accomplishment. In contrast, regulation in relation to oughts involves a prevention focus, which is a regulatory state concerned with protection and safety. <a href="#c24">Mourali et al. (2007)</a> argued that individuals with a prevention focus—who prefer vigilant strategies of making correct rejections and avoiding mistakes—dislike extreme options (options that are attractive on some but unattractive on other attribute dimensions).

Here the first decision step is to consider contextual information and to pick (or not) the compromise option, B.

Both features are difficult to implement in a simultaneous-choice modeling approach. However, it seems premature to favor one framework over the other. More applications are needed to explore sequential and simultaneous influences in a decision process.</p><a id="met-17-4-665-ID0EABCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Related Models</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The presented modeling approach is related to multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (<a href="#c2">Batchelder, 2009</a>; <a href="#c4">Batchelder &amp; Riefer, 1999</a>) and diagnostic measurement (DM) models (<a href="#c31">Rupp et al., 2010</a>). Both classes of models share the notion that variations in categorical outcome measures can be explained by multiple discrete stages or processes. Originally, the development of MPT and DM models was motivated by specific applications in cognitive psychology and educational measurement, respectively. MPT models were used to assess the influence of such cognitive processing capacities as memory storage and memory retrieval. DM models were applied to diagnose discrete skills (or the lack thereof) in solving mathematics items. These different objectives influenced greatly the subsequent refinement and addition of features to both classes of models.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By being tailored to a specific experimental paradigm, the parameters of a MPT model are defined, such that they speak directly to the postulated cognitive architecture in an experimental task. Because the main emphasis in applying MPT models is on testing theories in cognitive psychology, typically MPT models do not include person- or item-specific effects. Instead, MPT analyses focus on counts obtained by summing categorical responses over individuals and items. In contrast, a typical DM application analyzes individual responses scored as correct or incorrect by postulating a set of attributes (in the form of latent classes) that a person must execute to solve an item. For example, to arrive at a correct answer to an algebra problem, basic skills in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division may be required. Thus, instead of simply scoring how test takers perform on a set of algebra items, DM models allow for the classification of their mastery of a set of discrete skills. Another distinguishing feature between these approaches is that MPT models are sequential in nature, whereas DM models are mostly silent in this regard. However, the importance of this distinction has not been explored. Typically, data collected in MPT and DM applications do not contain information about the temporal nature of the postulated processes. As a result, MPT specifications about the order of cognitive processes are based more on theoretical than on empirical considerations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Over the years, the scope of MPT and DM approaches has expanded, and they are now applied in a wider range of settings. Recent applications of MPT models include implicit attitude measurements (<a href="#c35">Sherman et al., 2008</a>), personality assessments (<a href="#c2">Batchelder, 2009</a>), and the modeling of binary choice data (<a href="#c3">Batchelder, Hu, &amp; Smith, 2009</a>). Moreover, <a href="#c19">Klauer (2010)</a> proposed a general Bayesian framework for the estimation of individual differences. DM models were also developed in different directions (for a review, see <a href="#c31">Rupp et al., 2010</a>), with the result that it has become increasingly difficult to define clearly the methodological boundaries between these two classes of models. One major distinction is still the application goal, with DM models emphasizing diagnostic classification of individuals and MPT models targeting different experimental paradigms in cognitive psychology.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With its focus on response processes to polytomous items, the presented approach is particularly useful for the investigation of judgment and choice processes. The consideration of item- and person-specific effects for each postulated stage, coupled with the inclusion of stage-specific covariates, allows for detailed investigations of well-known but not yet well-understood judgment and choice phenomena. For example, the proposed approach provides a new way to study response-style and response-set effects (<a href="#c29">Rorer, 1965</a>). Response styles refer to enduring tendencies in answering items that are not specific to the item content. Examples include tendencies to agree with items, to give extreme as opposed to moderate responses, and to give middle or neutral responses (<a href="#c11">Cronbach, 1950</a>). In contrast to response styles, response sets are related directly to the item content and refer to the motivation of respondents to answer items in a way that facilitates their self-presentation. For example, when measuring compliance with rules and regulations in downloading movies, in online dating settings, or in accurately completing a questionnaire, respondents have been shown to differ not only in their behavior in these different domains but also in their motivation to present themselves in a positive way (<a href="#c38">Sinha &amp; Mandel, 2008</a>; <a href="#c45">Toma, Hancock, &amp; Ellison, 2008</a>). There is some evidence to suggest that response-set effects are a result of a stagewise process (<a href="#c46">Tourangeau et al., 2000</a>), according to which respondents arrive at an initial response on the basis of retrieval processes then subsequently decide whether to edit this response and report a more positive or less revealing answer instead. Using the approach presented here, it is straightforward to implement these stages and test the degree to which positive self-presentation biases affect the observed responses. More generally, modeling how individuals form their responses or choose among options via multiple stages or processes provides a promising methodological approach that may significantly advance the field of judgment and decision making.</p><a id="met-17-4-665-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_91" title="Concluding Remarks">Concluding Remarks</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this article, I discussed in detail two applications demonstrating the potential usefulness of modeling multiple response processes in judgment and choice applications via a tree structure. When polytomous items were decomposed into pseudoitems that were fitted, in turn, by item response models, a parsimonious and easily interpretable representation was obtained that provides new insights about how responses are formed to Likert items and how decision makers choose among multiple options depending on their regulatory focus. Moreover, I showed that answers to the pseudoitems can be related to covariates to account for individual differences in each of the multiple response processes. The proposed approach can be implemented readily with current software programs that allow for maximum-likelihood estimation of item response models with missing data.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although several examples of multiple process models for the analysis of judgment and choice data were presented, this list is by no means exhaustive. Other applications may lead to different tree representations because multiple response processes are likely to depend on the questioning format and the application context. However, as long as the multiple responses can be measured with pseudoitems, the same methods that are discussed here can be used. As illustrated by the two applications, it is straightforward to formulate, estimate, and validate multiple process representations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More work remains to be done. Perhaps the most critical issue is that an observed response may not always allow for an unambiguous identification of the underlying response process. To some extent, this issue can be addressed by extending item response models for the pseudoitems so they can allow for such process-related features as response times (<a href="#c20">Klein Entink, Fox, &amp; van der Linden, 2009</a>). For example, when modeling System 1 and System 2 processing in reasoning tasks, one could take into account that immediate responses are faster, on average, than deliberate ones, which would provide additional information about whether an observed response is a result of System 1 or System 2 processing. A complementary approach is to allow for the possibility that an observed response can be a result of more than one latent response process (<a href="#c22">Maris, 1995</a>). However, identifiability and estimation are considerably more complex in this case. Still, in view of the potential prevalence of multiple latent responses, these are important topics for future research.</p><a id="met-17-4-665-ID0E0UB0BBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_97" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Alter, A.

For example, for trichotomous items, the category probabilities are given by <a href="#eq3">Equations 3</a>–<a href="#eq5">5</a> and for Likert items with five response categories by <a href="#eq6">Equations 6</a>–<a href="#eq10">10</a>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For an item with <em>K</em> response categories, we can estimate up to <em>K</em> − 1 stage-specific person parameters.

As shown in the next section, Mplus or item response theory packages that allow for missing data can be used for this purpose. The fit of multiple-process models can be assessed in the same way as single-process item response theory models. For a small number of items, observed and expected response frequencies can be compared using likelihood ratio tests. <a href="#c15">Glas (2010)</a> reviewed alternative methods for assessing item and person fit when frequency tables are sparse.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When the number of random effects is small, it is useful to plot the category-specific trace lines. Consider, for example, a scenario in which individuals are asked several sensitive questions about their compliance behavior with certain rules and regulations. Occasionally, these individuals are noncompliant, but instead of giving a truthful (“yes”) answer, they refuse to answer the question. A two-stage process is well suited to describe this response behavior. At the first stage, a person gives a “no” response when he or she has been compliant. If the person has been noncompliant, he or she decides to either report the noncompliant behavior or refuse to answer the question at the second stage. Thus, there are two sources of individual differences. The first source refers to the degree of compliance with the domain under study, and the second source refers to the propensity of individuals to answer the question truthfully. <a href="#fig6">Figure A1</a> provides a graphical representation of these response tendencies in the extreme case when noncompliance is perfectly correlated with a person's propensity to refuse answering the sensitive question. The left panel of <a href="#fig6">Figure A1</a> shows the probabilistic relationships between giving a “no” response and the noncompliance level of the respondents at the first stage and between refusing to answer the question and the noncompliance level of the respondents at the second stage. The right panel depicts the three category probabilities “no,” “yes,” and “response refusal” for different noncompliance levels. The trace line of the “yes” response probabilities is single peaked. Thus, noncompliant respondents may initially admit to their behavior but then they may become increasingly more likely to refuse to answer the question. A measurement model under the standard assumption of a monotonic relationship between noncompliance and the probability of a “yes” response would be misspecified and could provide only a biased representation of this process.<br /><br /><a id="fig6"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/cc979c6db2574e3d6b8140c4564994fc/571cc320/pdh/met/met-17-4-665-fig6a.gif" alt="met-17-4-665-fig6a.gif" title="Figure A1.

Examples of this conversion are shown in <a href="#tbl1">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#tbl2">2</a>. For example, for the analysis of the Likert items, each rating is recoded as responses to three binary items that can take on missing values as well. Thus, in the business ethics application, the two Likert items are converted into six binary items that are labeled ×11 and ×12 for the first response process, ×21 and ×22 for the second response process, and ×31 and ×32 for the third response process. Values that are missing by design are coded −9. In addition, the two covariates age and educational degree (abbreviated <em>edu</em>) are included in the data set.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Below I provide the Mplus (<a href="#c25">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998–2010</a>) code for the analysis of the business ethics ratings, including covariates. This program estimates the random effects by numerical integration. Because the random effects are specified to follow a multivariate normal distribution, Gauss–Hermite integration with 15 quadrature points is used. The item loadings are constrained to be 1, which allows for the estimation of the full covariance matrix of the random effects. The last line of the code specifies the estimation of the covariate effects on each of the subprocesses defined by the pseudoitems. The online supplemental materials contain the full Mplus output for the data in <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>.
