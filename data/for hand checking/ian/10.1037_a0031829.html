For this reason, it is among the oldest and most developed topics of study in experimental psychology. Reading aloud is one task that is commonly used to test theoretical ideas about how people read. Such ideas are turned into computational models of reading aloud that predict response times (RTs) on a word-by-word basis, such as the dual-route cascaded model (DRC; <a href="#c26">Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, &amp; Ziegler, 2001</a>) and connectionist dual-process plus model (CDP+; <a href="#c45">Perry, Ziegler, &amp; Zorzi, 2007</a>). Such models are designed to explain the effects of properties of words—such as how long and how common they are—on reading. Indeed, to legitimately claim to understand and explain the processes of reading, we require not only effects but explicit theoretical models of those effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One way to assess these models—and hence the corresponding explanations—is to compare these models’ predictions with large data-sets containing observed RTs for many words (known as <em>mega-studies</em>; e.g., <a href="#c18">Balota &amp; Spieler, 1998</a>; <a href="#c19">Balota et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c56">Seidenberg &amp; Waters, 1989</a>; <a href="#c60">Spieler &amp; Balota, 1997</a>; <a href="#c64">Treiman, Mullennix, Bijeljac-Babic, &amp; Richmond-Welty, 1995</a>). The natural way to examine such correspondence is to correlate the observed and predicted RTs across words, and the correspondence is usually summarized with the <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> statistic (over words).<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, a perfect correlation is not to be expected of any model, because there is some variation between one occasion on which a person reads a word and a different occasion on which they read the same word, typically treated as experimental <em>noise</em> by averaging over these occasions. When a model does not make different predictions about these different occasions, it will inevitably fall short of perfect prediction, even if it correctly explains the differences associated with properties of the words. Therefore, to interpret such correlations, we need to know how well a model could possibly predict the response time for any given word. That is, how large a discrepancy between observed and predicted mean item RTs may be written off as due to noise?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Various techniques have been used to produce such estimates of the noise contribution to the mean RT for each word. These techniques rely on examining the variability between the different occasions on which a word has been read, but these occasions involve different participants, not the same participant. So, the estimate of what cannot be explained includes both variability that is due to different occasions and variability that has to do with individual differences. Moreover, some of these individual differences are systematically linked to the properties of words.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For instance, if the RT to BREAD is 400 ms with one participant and 600 ms with another participant, the 200-ms discrepancy could be due to any combination of (a) noise,<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup> (b) an individual difference in average RT, or (c) an individual difference in the effect of a word-level variable (e.g., length). Analysis techniques that treat individual differences as noise will necessarily overestimate the amount of noise contributing to the mean RT for each word. This overestimation of noise results in an underestimation of the variability that a model should explain, leading to an overestimation of the success of models.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">If 10% of the variance in the data were due to noise, and 10% were due to individual differences, then an analysis that treats individual differences as noise would only set a target of 80% variance explained for a model, when, in fact, 90% could in fact be explained. We aim to estimate the percentage of variance that is due to effects of the properties of words (i.e., not noise), even when these effects differ between participants. By doing so, the present research establishes a more stringent and accurate target for the evaluation of our understanding of reading (as instantiated by quantitative models).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of course, if the available data do not have the same person reading each word repeatedly, there is limited information available to distinguish the sources of variability that are individual differences from those that are noise. By treating individual differences as noise, a lenient criterion is constructed, but this is both more desirable than a too-strict criterion that rejects a correct model and useful if it rejects incorrect models despite its leniency. A model that correctly explains the various effects should have numerical parameters that can be altered to accommodate individual differences in these effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Previous approaches to the calculation of <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> criteria have approached the difficulty of the conflation of individual differences and noise in different ways. All of these involve simplifying assumptions that are summarized in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> and explained below. Our approach does not rely on any of these simplifying assumptions.<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/b75d6bc5d8336a0fa74d978fa7c25add/571c79d1/pdh/xlm/xlm-39-4-1037-tbl1a.gif" alt="xlm-39-4-1037-tbl1a.gif" title="Statistical Assumptions That Would Ideally Be Avoided in the Estimation of R2 Targets for Cognitive Models and Techniques of Estimation" /><em>Statistical Assumptions That Would Ideally Be Avoided in the Estimation of R2 Targets for Cognitive Models and Techniques of Estimation</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One approach (e.g., <a href="#c55">Seidenberg &amp; Plaut, 1998</a>; <a href="#c59">Sibley, Kello, &amp; Seidenberg, 2009</a>) has been to use correlations between participants or groups of participants to estimate the non-noise variance. This has the advantage that it does not assume that all relevant effects are known and entered into the analysis. However, such analyses are based on normal distributional assumptions, which are well-known to be incorrect for response times. Moreover, this approach treats individual differences that can be characterized with a difference in intercept and overall slope as non-noise, but other individual differences—such as one participant being very length-sensitive while another being very frequency-sensitive—as noise. Effectively, this approach makes a <em>general speed</em> assumption that the only differences between participants are in intercept and slope. Thus, participant–item interactions can only be due to these differences in general speed. In addition, this method uses a data set to stand in for the correct model in estimating how well a correct model will correlate with data. However, the difference between the correct model and data that stands in for it is that the data will contain noise. In effect, the incorrect assumption is made that model predictions contain noise.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More recently, a second version of this approach has been developed by <a href="#c51">Rey, Courrieu, Schmidt-Weigand, and Jacobs (2009)</a>, which uses a <em>Monte Carlo</em> method: It simulates several new subgroups of participants by randomly selecting participants from the actual data, from which correlation estimates for the full group can be calculated. By using the Monte Carlo method, normal distributional assumptions are avoided. Even more recently, an adjustment has been made to this method to account for the absence of noise in model predictions (<a href="#c30">Courrieu, Brand-d’Abrescia, Peereman, Spieler, &amp; Rey, 2011</a>). These are the only changes in assumptions that these developments of the method make.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another common approach has been to define a set of effects for which models are expected to account and use as the target the <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> of a regression model with those predictors. For instance, <a href="#c60">Spieler and Balota (1997)</a> found that a three-factor regression model (log. frequency, orthographic <em>N,</em> length) outperformed contemporary computational models (<a href="#c47">Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, &amp; Patterson, 1996</a>; <a href="#c54">Seidenberg &amp; McClelland, 1989</a>) on this criterion. Also, <a href="#c45">Perry, et al. (2007)</a> compared their model favorably with this criterion. However, a stricter criterion could be set with more predictors, were they known (cf. <a href="#c4">Adelman &amp; Brown, 2008a</a>; <a href="#c16">Balota, Cortese, Sergent-Marshall, Spieler, &amp; Yap, 2004</a>), but it is likely some predictors will be unknown. Moreover, just because the criterion is met, that does not mean that the model is successful in explaining the effects of interest; it may be capturing other variance. To address this problem, <a href="#c20">Besner (1999)</a> and <a href="#c4">Adelman and Brown (2008a)</a> suggested comparing the predicted and observed sizes of the effects, but the method is still limited by the list of known effects. The method operates on item means and so refers only to the average of participants. Consequently, no particular structure of individual differences is assumed—and in particular, not a structure based on intercept and slope alone—except that the participant–item interactions must relate to the known effects. Moreover, it also uses the normal distributional assumptions, which are incorrect for response times. This method does, however, have the advantage that the correlation is calculated on the basis that predictions from lexical variables do not contain noise, producing a correct comparison with computational models.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To avoid the assumption that all relevant variables are known and to explicitly include individual differences, one might wish to construct a linear mixed-effects regression (lmer; cf. <a href="#c14">Baayen, Davidson, &amp; Bates, 2008</a>) to include adjustments (random intercepts) for words and participants. The per-word adjustments allow for arbitrary unknown effects. To account for individual differences not involving the intercept—such as one participant being particularly sensitive to length—participant slope adjustments (random slopes) of the lexical variables could be included. While these allow for participants differing in more than intercept and a single slope, the adjustments (which are a form of participant–item interaction) are limited to known slopes (i.e., those involving the known effects). The estimate of noise from this approach would be calculated on the basis that predictions from lexical variables do not contain noise, so would be useful for assessing computational models. Typically, such models use the normal distributional assumptions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The analogous analysis of variance model has participants and words as factors. The lexical variable effects would be constructed as contrasts within the main effect of word, and these could interact with participants. The same problematic assumptions apply. In particular, the per-participant item effects must be limited to the known effects. This is because in data sets where there is just one observation per participant per item, including arbitrary item effects on a per participant basis (i.e., the complete Participant × Word interaction) would exhaust all the variance in the data set, incorrectly leaving none as noise. If we correctly wish to allow in our statistical model that individual differences may occur in the unknown effects, we must obtain multiple observations of each participant–word combination. In such a data set, the participant–word interaction is not confounded with the trial-to-trial noise.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Additionally, estimating the average over individuals causes problems when testing models because although the magnitude of particular effects may vary between participants, using average data will never require models to account for the range of effect magnitudes shown, only the average magnitude. Moreover, averaging over participants may be misleading as to the underlying functional form (shape) of some effects (e.g.,<a href="#c32">W. K. Estes, 1956</a>; Heathcote, Brown, &amp; Mewhort, 2002). Therefore, to the extent that models are distinguished by their predictions of functional form of effects, such as the frequency effect (e.g., <a href="#c5">Adelman &amp; Brown, 2008b</a>), average data are insufficient. On both counts, if possible, it is therefore preferable to analyze participants separately. However, no existing database has sufficient data to support such individual analysis of participants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With sufficient data from each participant, with replications of each participant–word combination, we can avoid the aforementioned problematic statistical assumptions, and analyze each participant individually. This allows us to construct a statistical model that can accommodate effects that are not known in advance. Moreover, by analyzing them separately, participants may differ arbitrarily, not only in intercept and slope. It is particularly important that we can examine the effect of word and its interaction with participant without restriction to the known effects. By using a Monte Carlo technique appropriately, we can also avoid assuming model predictions have noise and allow that RTs are not normally distributed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Thus, the present work seeks to address the aforementioned fundamental problems in assessing models (see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>) by reporting a mega-study on four individuals who read 2,820 words, 50 times each. By way of comparison, <a href="#c60">Spieler and Balota’s (1997)</a> 30 participants read each of these words once; and Elexicon’s naming data (<a href="#c19">Balota et al., 2007</a>) contain 25 observations for each of 40,481 words, spread over 444 participants (who read 2,530 or 2,531 words each). Notably, neither of these older data sets contains the participant–word repetitions that are necessary to accurately test models of reading aloud. The present study is also the first mega-study to have hand-coding of response times, which is more accurate than the typical voice-key coding (at least, when voice keys are being assessed, hand coding is used as the benchmark for correctness, e.g., <a href="#c50">Rastle &amp; Davis, 2002</a>). On both the grounds of the precision of individual measurement and the accuracy of coding, these data can be seen as key for the future assessment of cognitive models of visual word recognition. The full database is available in the online supplemental materials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We use these data to (a) demonstrate the differences between individuals, (b) estimate the proportion of variance in individuals’ item mean RTs that is in principle explicable (not noise), and (c) attempt to explain this variance with existing and new factors. We emphasize the variance in item mean RTs (rather than the total variance in individual trials), because this accords with other uses of mega-study data, and because item-property effects have been the preeminent source of information about the processes of visual word recognition.</p><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_26" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0EECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were recruited by an e-mail advertisement to the staff, faculty and postgraduates of the Department of Psychology at the University of Warwick.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">D was a 27- to 28-year-old British postdoctoral researcher in psychology at the time of the study.

This may reflect the different measurement method for response times (hand coding vs. voice key) used in the two studies, or it may reflect differences in the articulatory influences on response times between our participants and the average participant. Of our participants, A is clearly the most similar to the average undergraduate from the past studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Even so, the correlations between participants were moderate, but far from perfect. Of course, the imperfect correlations that are exhibited consist of both the actual underlying differences between participants, and the variation in each participant’s response to each word. The structure of the present data set, with 50 replications of each word for each participant, allows us to calculate the split-half (Sessions 1, 2, 5, 6,… vs. Sessions 3, 4, 7, 8,…) reliability and thereby estimate the reliability of each person’s data with the Spearman-Brown correction. These reliability estimates were D: .869, A: .823, M: .681, U: .861 for the raw values and D: .623, A: .816, M: .245, U: .492 for the residuals after first phoneme; overall, these were generally good.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given these estimates of reliability and the observed correlations, we can estimate the underlying correlation (adjusting for the fact that observed correlations correlate both the signal and the noise—attenuation—due to imperfect reliability) using the standard method from classical test theory. For the raw values, these were D versus A: .657, D versus M: .563, D versus U: .614, A versus M: .577, A versus U: .708, M versus U: .743. For the residuals after first phoneme, these were D versus A: .488, D versus M: .599, D versus U: .708, A versus M: .797, A versus U: .612, M versus U: .772.

As might be expected from the low disattenuated correlations, such a relationship was heavily violated for every pair of participants (all <em>t</em> &gt; 14, <em>p</em> &lt; .0001). When the same procedure was applied to the correlations and reliabilities calculated from the residuals after first phoneme in the lower part of <a href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>, four of the six pairs showed a strong violation (those showing the lower disattenuated correlations; <em>t</em> &gt; 3.5, <em>p</em> &lt; .001), and the other two did not (<em>t</em> &lt; 0; only positive values give evidence to reject a null hypothesis.). That is, participant differences could not be accounted for by noise plus a linear relationship, as the models used in many analyses assume.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, these analyses show that there are stable individual differences between participants that go beyond general speed in terms of a different average or a simple multiplier (which might correspond to a different cycles-to-milliseconds conversion in a simulated model). While it would be possible to perform analyses on these data that do not assume a general speed relationship between participants, and thus calculate better targets to apply to the average data, this would still underestimate the strength of constraint that these data can place on models. Given that the item average data from each of the individual participants are reasonably reliable, we could in principle ask how well a model fares in explaining the systematic properties of the item data of each participant. This would require that a model is adjusted to the particular data set in some way to account for the maximum possible variance, as is true of any attempt to rule out models using <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> targets (<a href="#c4">Adelman &amp; Brown, 2008a</a>). The comparison of course also requires that we have an appropriate estimate of how much of the variance in the item means is systematically due to item properties (as averaging reduces but does not eliminate noise and other irrelevant influences).</p><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0EGBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">How Much Variance Would a Correct Model Explain?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We therefore now turn to our main question: If a model gave the correct mean RT for each word for each participant, how much of the observed variance <em>in item mean RT</em> would that model explain (i.e., how high would its <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> be) for each participant? This will not be 100% because there is trial-to-trial noise in the data. Put otherwise, the question is how much misprediction by a model should we tolerate as due to noise? The answer to this question is critical for evaluating models of reading.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To avoid the assumptions of equality of variance and normal distributions for each participant–word combination, we used Monte Carlo simulations where each simulated RT is drawn from the observed RTs (adjusted for the main effect of session) for that participant–word combination (replicated 1,001 times). Such a Monte Carlo bootstrap procedure assumes that the observed distribution is a good approximation to the true distribution. We then examined how well a sample of the size of our data set would be captured by a perfect model that predicted the true underlying participant–word mean RTs. This was done in terms of the error sum-of-squares, because its distribution (unlike the correlation coefficient’s or <em>R</em><sup>2</sup>’s) does not depend on the quality of our estimate of the true values of the underlying mean RTs (which property is known as being a pivotal statistic).

As the targets in the second row of <a href="#tbl5">Table 5</a> indicate, up to ca. 90% (depending on the participant) in each participant’s data would be explained by a model correctly generating the mean for each word for each participant, because we have averaged over the noise (and sequential effects) at the trial-to-trial level, although much of this is due to first phoneme. We ask here whether the factors that we already know affect visual word recognition account for this variance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The early criticisms of computational models’ abilities to account for item-level variance from <a href="#c60">Spieler and Balota (1997)</a> made use of a three-variable regression (log. frequency, length, orthographic <em>N</em>) that has been used as a standard target by some modelers. For instance, <a href="#c45">Perry et al. (2007)</a> give their CDP+ model a check mark as successful on an item-variance criterion because it performs similarly in <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> to such a regression. <a href="#tbl5">Table 5</a> includes the <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> values for such a regression (after first phoneme). The results show that these three variables account for rather little of the variance in the data, even when the proportion is rescaled to exclude first phoneme and noise variance: Less than one sixth of the variance we would hope to be explained is due to these three variables. As such, these data show this to be a very weak test of a model’s ability to account for item-level variance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The weakness of this criterion can be seen as not particularly surprising because a wider range of variables is known to affect word recognition, and we have previously used such a wider range for assessing models. In particular, <a href="#c4">Adelman and Brown (2008a)</a> used a regression model for <a href="#c60">Spieler and Balota’s (1997)</a> mean item response times, which included 17 orthographic and phonological variables and interactions to assess the performance of the dual-route cascaded (DRC) model (<a href="#c26">Coltheart et al., 2001</a>), which is among the most influential models of visual word recognition.

To quantify this effect we used the confusion probabilities (at distance) observed by <a href="#c21">Bouma (1971)</a> to calculate a notional probability (product of the probability of the individual confusions) of confusing the word with its nearest neighbor (the word with the highest confusion probability). Words with high probability confusion neighbors were read more slowly by D (increase in <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> of 0.14%) and U (0.09%), but not A (0.00%) and M (0.02%). We also calculated the notional probability of correctly identifying all the letters in the word. Words whose letters were not confusable were read faster by D (0.29%) and M (0.09%), but more slowly by A (0.12%), with no effect (0.02%) on U.

These data also showed the inhibitory effect of number of features. Moreover, the zero-order correlations of RT and number of features was positive for each of our participants. Given that Pexman et al. used results of a feature listing task to count features, it seems likely that the discrepant results here reflect the salience or accessibility of features (over and above the number of features) being important in their counts and for naming RTs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Familiarity and age of acquisition</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Familiarity and age of acquisition variables have been offered as alternatives or additions to the more objective corpus-based measures of experience of language.

As such, any cost of second position exceptions should be exacerbated when the first phoneme is plosive; that is, there should be an interaction between whether the first phoneme is plosive and whether the position of irregularity is second, and this pattern has been observed (<a href="#c27">Cortese, 1998</a>; <a href="#c38">Kawamoto, Kello, Jones, &amp; Bame, 1998</a>).

Although these improvements were rather small (a total of less than 4%) in terms of overall <em>R</em><sup>2</sup>, of the relevant (i.e., non-noise, non-first-phoneme) variance, together these variables explained up to an extra 11% (for D).

Adding variance after first phoneme, accessibility (best choice of WF or CD, cubic splines) contributed the most for D (first phoneme plus accessibility: 58.70%), A (57.05%), and U (62.97%). For M, the single factor that (after first phoneme) increased variance accounted for most was PLD20 (first phoneme plus PLD20: 56.69%). However, for both M and U, if whammies and irregularities were combined to form a single position of spelling-sound abnormality variable (with six levels), this accounted for slightly more variance (M: 56.77%; U: 63.33%).</p><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0EBBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Effects of Practice</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Analogous to the problem we described with individual differences in the older mega-studies, we can only examine the variation in effects with practice (or indeed, any session-to-session change) for those effects that are known; for the intercept and the nine variables of our simpler regression model (from <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), the variation over session is illustrated in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. There is very little evidence that practice increased the efficiency of word processing in the mean RTs, and the practice trends in the individual effects—mostly involving a slight weakening of the effects—are quite small relative to the variability. Weakening of the effects might be a form of response time homogenization (cf. <a href="#c63">Taylor &amp; Lupker, 2001</a>); that is, as participants become familiar with the structure of the stimulus set, their decision rule incorporates an expectation of the ideal RT; as the influence of this ideal becomes greater, RTs become more similar and item effects become smaller. There is some suggestion in the data that the inhibitory neighborhood effects are due to practice, possibly reflecting an adjustment to the precise visual properties of the experimental display. That it is due to practice does not diminish the implied requirement on models that the possibility of an inhibitory neighborhood size effect be explained. Similar changes appeared in first phoneme effects over the duration of the experiment.<br /><br /><a id="fig2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/b084b09cd7bcf88f24ec9f5ddf613064/571c79d1/pdh/xlm/xlm-39-4-1037-fig2a.gif" alt="xlm-39-4-1037-fig2a.gif" title="Figure 2.

The structure of our data—with repetitions of each word for each participant—allowed us to perform analyses without problematic assumptions about individual differences (see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). Removing these problematic assumptions made our estimate of the noise in the data more accurate than was previously possible. This more accurate noise estimate sets an accurate target <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> for models to achieve. Using our regressions, we were able to explain between 56% and 69% of the variance in item means for each of our participants. Much of this explained variance was due to first phoneme—a factor usually only treated as a control variable—and some of the unexplained variance could (in the context of item means) be considered inexplicable noise. Of the variance due to neither noise nor first phoneme, our 31-variable regressions accounted for between 30 and 35%.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This was better than the <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> achieved by DRC, CDP+, and PDP models (2–11% of this non-noise, non-first-phoneme variance), though in principle these models might be improved by adjustments to individual differences in the parameters (<a href="#c8">Adelman, Sabatos-DeVito, Marquis, &amp; Estes, 2011</a>). In fact, they performed similarly to a three-variable (log. frequency, length, neighborhood size) regression model that has often been used as a model comparison. However, this three-variable regression obtained only 7–16% of the variance that could not be attributed to first phoneme or noise, suggesting this is a very weak target for cognitive modeling endeavors.</p><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0EEACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Idiosyncrasies and Individual Differences</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Analyzing individual participants will reveal their idiosyncrasies, and so typical patterns of performance will often not emerge. The well above average reading or reading experience of three of our participants (D, M, and U) appears to be the source of one set of differences from average performance; in contrast, A was more similar to the typical undergraduate participant. These three participants showed both atypical (inhibitory) neighborhood effects (both in terms of <em>N</em> and the OLD20 and PLD20 measures) and no imageability effect. We have observed an association between vocabulary and neighborhood size effects in naming (Adelman, Sabatos-DeVito, &amp; Marquis, YEAR), and there is also an association between reading skill and imageability effects (e.g., <a href="#c62">Strain &amp; Herdman, 1999</a>). In effect, better readers are more able to rely upon precise formal identification of individual words (i.e., lexical quality, e.g., <a href="#c12">Andrews &amp; Hersch, 2010</a>; <a href="#c44">Perfetti, 1992</a>), which might explain why our three participants showed atypical effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One participant (M) showed further idiosyncrasies. He showed a relatively weak sensitivity to frequency, and he did not show inhibition from orthographic length. In our initial analyses, his orthographic length effect appeared to be facilitatory. However, this was in fact attributable to phonological length when this variable was added to the regression. That is, he showed a facilitatory phonological length effect. Such an effect was also present after the orthographic length effect was partialled in <a href="#c60">Spieler and Balota’s (1997)</a> data (<a href="#c4">Adelman &amp; Brown, 2008a</a>) and at least for exception words for D, A, and U. That is, there are countermanding influences of orthographic and phonological length, which have probably contributed to the difficulty of finding unique variance from length effects for words in smaller studies (cf. <a href="#c66">Weekes, 1997</a>). The orthographic influence may be letter-by-letter processing in at least one route (as in the DRC and CDP+), or it may be some other form of limited capacity processing, such as visual competition (simple division of processing resources over letters, e.g., <a href="#c2">Adelman, 2011</a>) or a limited accuracy in the coding of longer visual sequences (<a href="#c25">Chang, Furber, &amp; Welbourne, 2012</a>). The phonological influence might relate to reduced competition in lexical selection at a phonological level for longer words, less overlapping representations at a phonological level for longer words, or—given the relationship between orthographic and phonological length—this may reflect some aspect of processing multiletter graphemes that is not captured by the whammying variable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The idiosyncrasies that these participants show do nothing to invalidate our results. First, that participant A’s performance was similar to previous studies indicates that nothing about our method was so unusual as to make the task different from other studies. Second, case studies have long since (e.g., <a href="#c48">Plaut &amp; Shallice, 1993</a>) been sources of data regarding visual word recognition; that we have no reason to believe the present participants have suffered neurological damage does not excuse theories from explaining these individuals’ performance. Ultimately, models will come to quantitatively explain both what differs between individuals and how individuals come to differ; however, to do so, models must incorporate sensitivity to the same factors to which individuals are sensitive.</p><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0EDACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What About the Effects of Practice?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The main effect of practice (i.e., one affecting all words equally) is assumed to be within the grasp of models (by use of the average intercept over all sessions) by our adjustment for session mean. However, one might expect that certain variables’ influences—particularly frequency’s—would vary with practice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At first glance, it might seem that our data are critically contaminated with practice effects, but in fact our data are less contaminated by practice than other studies for two reasons. First, reading aloud is an overlearned task—used heavily in the early stages of reading instruction—that is relatively immune to task-specific learning. As illustrated in the first panel of <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, there is no overall trend for response times to become shorter with practice. Second, variability due to practice also exists in other databases because individuals differ in how practiced they are at reading. For instance, in <a href="#c60">Spieler and Balota’s (1997)</a> data set, they averaged together 31 observations of each word, each average containing one observation from each participant. In each of our four data sets, for each word we have averaged together 50 observations from the same participants at different points in time. On average, between one trial with a particular word and some arbitrary<a id="b-fn9"> </a><sup><a href="#fn9" /></sup> other trial with that word, on average around 47,000 experimental trials—or slightly fewer than the number of words in <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>—intervened. In comparison to the differences in reading practice between one arbitrarily chosen undergraduate and another, this one-novel’s-length difference seems quite minimal.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To be clear, by choosing to form each database from a single individual, we have chosen to move from having databases in which variability is contributed by trait individual differences and potentially large interindividual differences in practice to having databases (one per subject) in which variability is contributed by smaller intraindividual changes in practice over the course of the experiment but not by trait individual differences. Understanding such individual differences is, of course, important, but individual differences are a distinct problem to the one considered here, and so need studies of a different design to the present one (cf. <a href="#c8">Adelman et al., 2011</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As described above, we can only examine the variation in effects with practice for those effects that are known, as we have done in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. The theoretical implications of the observed changes—such as whether the changes are stimulus-specific or task-general (<a href="#c31">Dutilh, Krypotos, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2011</a>)—are beyond the scope of the present article, and the data are not optimal to examine this question, because there are no unpracticed baseline items.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, they do cause our noise estimate to be an overestimate, because a replication could not contain all early or all late trials (whereas our simulated replications could). We therefore removed the session variation by further adjusting the observed RTs by interactions of the nine predictor variables with session number. The revised <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> targets were higher by 0.01% for each participant. While these practice effects are theoretically important and will account for variance at the trial level, when models are assessed at the level of item means, the additional stability provided by trends in practice is negligible.</p><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0ECACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What About Sequential or Priming Effects?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">From the viewpoint of a statistical criterion that averages RTs over different occurrences of a word, any differences between different occurrences that do not systematically recur are treated as noise; this includes effects that can be attributed to properties of the preceding trial or trials—including priming and changes in pathway control (cf. <a href="#c52">Reynolds &amp; Besner, 2008</a>)—when the order of trials is randomized. Moreover, even in a statistical analysis that incorporates such sequential effects, their inclusion does nothing to increase or decrease the estimated error of the observed mean item RTs as estimates of the underlying mean item RTs (although it reduces the error in the individual trial predictions). Model analyses can be used to attempt to remove these influences, but estimates based on conforming to a particular statistical model may distort the data in ways that it would be undesirable for cognitive models to attempt to mimic.<a id="b-fn10"> </a><sup><a href="#fn10" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This statistical point about sequential effects in a standard additive statistical model (where the effects are calculated relative to the mean over the data set) does not detract from the possibility that mechanistically sequential effects (which should be calculated relative to some other baseline) do ultimately explain some of the item-level variance, because they affect different items in different ways, that is, contribute a difference to the average. For instance, if items are responded to faster when the preceding item shares a contextual usage with them—a contextual priming effect—then items that occur in many contexts would show an advantage (i.e., this is one possible explanation of the contextual diversity effect shown by <a href="#c6">Adelman et al., 2006</a>). This priming effect would show up in both the item mean and trial-by-trial analyses; to the extent that an effect of this type systematically shows up in the item means, it is included in our estimates of an explicable effect. Only those priming (or other sequential) effects that associate with some items more than others affect the item averages and so are considered to be open to a model that predicts these items means (and therefore are included in our target <em>R</em><sup>2</sup>s). While these kinds of effects are not responsible for the shortfall in <em>R</em><sup>2</sup>, these data do provide a unique resource for examining sequential and priming effects over long trial sequences in reading.</p><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0EBACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Word Naming and Reading</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Word naming is but one task that is used to assess the processes of reading. Other tasks that are specifically focused on word-level variables include lexical decisions and perceptual identification. Higher level (e.g., grammatical) processing is often studied with eye-tracking measures. Of course, our results need not generalize perfectly to these other tasks. For instance, first phoneme is usually only found to be important for tasks involving spoken production, and accessibility measures like frequency have a much stronger influence on lexical decision. Ideally, analogous data sets will become available for these other tasks and measures.</p><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0EAACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, the assessments reported here suggest that psychologists’ current empirical and theoretical understanding of word naming is lacking. Our present understanding of the relevant factors reveals less than half of what is systematically due to word properties in word naming response times. Candidate areas for improvement include representations of semantics, visual similarity and articulatory duration, as well as the inclusion of morphological information. However, it is unlikely that these account for the majority of the remaining variance. In our opinion, it is likely that one or more major factors is currently overlooked. Testing such new ideas and finding new effects will be one of the major onward uses of these data. Neither practice nor sequential effects should be expected to improve predictions of item mean RTs, only individual trial RTs, and therefore would not substantially improve models on the criterion we use here. Moreover, attempts to model response times directly have been approaching a target that is simply far too low to be useful. That is, even if a model gave a detailed, quantitatively accurate account of how currently known word-level factors affect response times, the amount of variance systematically due to words but remaining unexplained would be so large as to render to the account uncompelling in our view. We hope the present data will provide some of both the impetus and the information needed to approach these unexplained properties of reading aloud; they give the most precise picture available of reading aloud by individual participants. These data and the criteria that they establish are critical for evaluating models of reading.</p><a id="xlm-39-4-1037-ID0EAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_192" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn1">1</a></sup> Such correlations simultaneously assess essentially all contrasts within the study, including those on which current models differ and those on which they do not.</p><a id="fn2" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn2">2</a></sup> Or practice, or priming, or other sequential effects that are treated as noise in a typical experiment comparing some words with some other words.

AMT currently has approximately 500,000 Workers in 190 countries around the world. It is ideal for the collection of large-scale data sets in which participants provide many relatively simple ratings. AMT has been used extensively by psychological researchers in recent years, and its use has been validated (e.g., <a href="#c24">Buhrmester, Kwang, &amp; Gosling, 2011</a>). These ratings are available in the Supplemental Materials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two hundred sixty-four distinct participants contributed to our ratings. All participants were registered by Amazon to be in the United States and completed a demographic questionnaire that included a first language question; only those participants aged over 18 years and responding “English” to this question were permitted to continue. Participants whose ratings either were invariant or appeared random were excluded and replaced, so that each of the 2,820 words was rated by exactly 40 approved raters. Participants were paid $0.05 (5 U.S. cents) for every 10 words that they rated. As described below, participants rated different numbers of words, at their discretion. Thus, payments ranged from $0.05 to $14.10, with an average payment of $2.14 (<em>SD</em> = $3.31).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The 2,820 stimuli from the reading aloud experiment were split into 282 sets of 10 words. Each participant was permitted to rate as many or as few of these sets (without repetition) as they wished, up to a total of 40 participants per set. Participants completed between one and 282 sets (i.e., rated between 10 and 2,820 words), with an average of 43 sets (430 words) per participant. On each presentation of a set, the order of the words within that set was randomized.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants who wished to take part in our study were instructed to complete a demographic questionnaire, which contained questions about gender, age, religion, income and first language, without being instructed as to the qualification criteria, which were at least 18 years of age and first language English. Those meeting these criteria were permitted to select to complete a task corresponding to a set of 10 words. On this first set, extended instructions were given, including examples of words of positive and negative valence, and high and low arousal. Participants were instructed to use the whole scale rather than just two or three different values, and to select the “don’t know” option if they were unfamiliar with the given word. Depending on the browser software settings used by the participant, this first set was identified as either the first time the relevant page was visited (using the cookie mechanism) or when the page had not been reached using the automatic get-next-task feature of AMT. Otherwise, a brief reminder of the instructions was given that appeared with every set; in this case, an option was provided to review the longer instructions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Each word from the list appeared in bold lowercase print above the center of a 7-point arousal scale and a 7-point valence scale, each implemented using radio buttons. A <em>don’t know this word</em> option appeared above each of these scales. Once an option had been selected for both scales, a button below the scales was activated that allowed participants to move to the next word. Once an option had been selected for both scales for all 10 words in the set, a button below the final scale was activated to allow participants to submit their ratings to the AMT server. This then either returned the participant to the list of available tasks, or—if the participant selected the appropriate option in the AMT interface—to the next set of 10 words, which was selected randomly without replacement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Submitted: </em>January 24, 2012<em> Revised: </em>November 12, 2012<em> Accepted: </em>November 13, 2012</p><hr noshade="noshade" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="copyright_info">This publication is protected by US and international copyright laws and its content may not be copied without the copyright holders express written permission except for the print or download capabilities of the retrieval software used for access.
