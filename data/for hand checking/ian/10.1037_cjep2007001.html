(DA) paradigm have shown that dividing participants' attention
between the encoding of the information presented and performing a secondary task resulted
in a clear detrimental effect on free recall, cued recall, and recognition memory
performance relative to conditions where full attention is paid to encoding the items (e.g.,
<a href="#c3">Baddeley, Lewis, Eldridge, &amp; Thomson,
1984</a>; <a href="#c6">Craik, Govoni,
Naveh-Benjamin, &amp; Anderson, 1996</a>; <a href="#c9">Fernandes &amp; Moscovitch, 2000</a>, <a href="#c10">2002</a>; <a href="#c21">Murdock, 1965</a>; <a href="#c24">Naveh-Benjamin, Craik, Gavrilescu, &amp; Anderson, 2000</a>;
<a href="#c25">Naveh-Benjamin, Craik, Guez, &amp; Dori,
1998</a>; <a href="#c33">Reinitz, Morrissey,
&amp; Demb, 1994</a>). Divided attention at encoding was shown to have
a similar effect on a variety of memory features, including memory for spatial location
(<a href="#c22">Naveh-Benjamin, 1987</a>), and
memory for frequency of occurrence (<a href="#c30">Naveh-Benjamin
&amp; Jonides, 1986</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For example, <a href="#c6">Craik et al. (1996)</a> showed that encoding single words and
word pairs results in a reliable decrement to secondary task performance. Furthermore,
manipulating emphasis by instructing participants to stress the memory task, the secondary
task, or both tasks equally, has complementary effects on the two tasks: As attention is
switched to the secondary task and away from the memory task, memory performance declines
and secondary task performance improves. These results indicate that encoding processes
require attention, and that the allocation of attention to encoding processes is under the
participant's conscious control (see also <a href="#c16">Kellog,
Cocklin, &amp; Bourne, 1982</a>; <a href="#c35">Szymanski &amp; MacLeod, 1996</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the detrimental effects of
DA at encoding on later memory performance are clear-cut, there is no
consensus regarding the locus of the effects of DA at encoding, nor the
processes that are hampered during encoding by the concurrent interfering activity. Several
types of processes may be affected by a concurrent activity, mediating the effects of
DA at encoding on later memory performance. These types include
initial perceptual analysis of the stimulus, semantic processes involved in item-specific
processing, and more strategic-effortful processes involved in the relational-elaborative
processing of information.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One possibility is that the decrease in
memory performance when attention is divided at encoding is related to a decrease in
strategic-effortful processing (<a href="#c13">Hasher &amp;
Zacks, 1979</a>). That is, while subjects are trying to perform the
secondary task, they lack the resources to enable them to use strategic-effortful processes
in encoding the information presented in the primary task. According to this view, those
aspects of encoding that do not require strategic-effortful processes would be much less
affected by the division of attention. This idea is intuitively appealing given its direct
relation to the notion of limited attentional resources, which states that the fewer the
resources available for encoding, the less participants can engage in strategic effortful
encoding, resulting in poorer memory performance. In spite of its intuitive appeal, however,
this idea has received mixed support. For example, manipulating the difficulty level of the
secondary task at encoding (e.g., <a href="#c1">Anderson &amp;
Craik, 1974</a>; <a href="#c26">Naveh-Benjamin,
Craik, Perretta, &amp; Tonev, 2000</a>) has shown that as the
difficulty of the concurrent task increases, subsequent memory performance declines. The
most straightforward interpretation of these results is that the more difficult secondary
task condition requires more attentional resources, leaving fewer resources available for
strategic-effortful processing of the encoded words.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Note, however, that this interpretation of
the results assumes that the fewer the attentional resources that are left for encoding, the
lower the probability that strategic encoding processes will be used for the words.
Therefore, the above results are not definitive, for they do not reflect the direct
measurement or manipulation of underlying strategic-effortful processes. Other studies also
providing indirect support for the claim that strategic processes are those affected by
divided attention show that DA during encoding mostly reduced recollection-based, rather
than familiarity-based, processing (e.g., <a href="#c12">Gardiner
&amp; Parkin, 1990</a>; <a href="#c14">Jacoby &amp; Kelley, 1992</a>; <a href="#c39">Yonelinas, 2002</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Do we have any direct evidence that
strategic-effortful processes are the ones affected by DA at encoding? In a series of
studies conducted during the 1980s, Craik provided such evidence, showing that under
DA at encoding, participants use shallower and less semantic
processes to encode the information. In a typical study, <a href="#c4">Craik (1982)</a> employed the orienting task procedure, where
for each item presented, participants were asked a question relating either to the
graphemic, phonemic, or semantic aspects of a word, with half of the words yielding a
positive answer and the other half a negative answer. Participants performed the task paying
either full attention to the words or while attending also to an auditory secondary task at
the same time. Recall performance showed that the divided attention participants showed the
greatest memory deficit under deeper levels of processing; this indicated that
strategic-effortful semantic processes are the ones most affected under
DA. Similar results, indicating a shallower level of processing under
DA at encoding conditions, were reported by <a href="#c5">Craik and Byrd (1982)</a> and <a href="#c32">Rabinowitz, Craik, and Ackerman (1982)</a>. In
addition, a recent study conducted by <a href="#c24">Naveh-Benjamin, Craik, Gavrilescu, and Anderson (2000)</a>, supported the
notion that DA at encoding changes the qualitative nature of encoding
such that it becomes less semantic in nature. Finally, recent studies using neuroimaging
techniques (e.g., <a href="#c2">Anderson et al.,
2000</a>; <a href="#c11">Fletcher et al.,
1995</a>) have indicated that DA at encoding reduces
encoding-related brain activity in the left inferior prefrontal cortex, an area shown in
other studies to be associated with deep strategic semantic processing (e.g.,
<a href="#c15">Kapur et al., 1994</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The above-mentioned studies provide
supportive evidence, coinciding with our intuitions, that DA at
encoding interrupts the deep-level strategic-effortful processes necessary for an adequate
encoding of incoming information. However, the results of several recent studies complicate
this picture. For example, recent studies conducted by <a href="#c7">Craik and Kester (2000)</a> provide some counter results. In a
typical study in this series, participants were presented with word pairs and asked to rate
the elaborateness of the connection they could create for each word pair. This was done
either under full attention or under DA where participants
simultaneously performed an auditory digit-monitoring task. Results showed that subsequent
performance on an unexpected cued recall task improved as the rated degree of elaboration
increased, and that this happened for both full- and divided-attention conditions. However,
in contrast to what is expected by the strategic effortful hypothesis, memory performance
for the DA condition was considerably lower than under the full
attention condition at each level of elaboration. That is, for the same degree of strategic
semantic elaboration, fewer words were recalled after being encoded under divided attention
than under full attention conditions. This implies that a different mechanism, in addition
to amount of strategic elaboration, must underlie the effects of DA at
encoding on later memory performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Likewise, recent studies in our laboratory
(e.g., <a href="#c23">Naveh-Benjamin, 2002</a>)
show that the magnitude of memory performance advantage under intentional as opposed to
incidental learning instructions during study is affected to the same degree in the case
when attention was divided at encoding as when information was studied under full attention.
If strategic/elaborative learning processes had been the only ones affected under
DA, we would have expected intentional learning to be affected by
DA much more than incidental learning, where no strategies were
employed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The above results by <a href="#c7">Craik and Kester (2000)</a> and <a href="#c23">Naveh-Benjamin (2002)</a> are not in line with the
hypothesis that DA at encoding has its greatest effect on
strategic-effortful processing. At the very least, these results do not support
across-the-board adverse effects of DA at encoding on
effortful-strategic processing; instead, it seems that DA may also
affect certain types of processing other than strategic-effortful ones.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another possibility is that the effects of
DA at encoding on later memory performance are mediated by
nonstrategic processes located further upstream in the continuum of processing. More
specifically, it may be the case that DA interrupts the initial
registration of the information. Intuitively, it seems reasonable that
DA conditions may impede the participant's ability to either perceive
the item to begin with or to fully perceptually register the presented event when the
participant's attention is focused on the secondary task.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A study reported by <a href="#c23">Naveh-Benjamin (2002)</a> examined this possibility.
Participants were presented with lists of words, each of which was presented in one of two
computer fonts, and encoded the information under conditions of either full attention or
DA. Participants were forewarned about an upcoming memory test on the
words. The results of a recognition test given after some interpolated activity, showed
clear effects of both DA and similarity of font: Words presented at
test in the same font as the one used during encoding were remembered better than those
words presented in a different font from the one used at encoding. There was, however, no
interaction between the two variables, implying that DA at encoding
does not disrupt the initial processing of perceptual aspects, in this case font
information. Such an interaction, showing a smaller advantage of same over different font
recognition in the DA condition than in the full attention condition,
would be expected if DA interrupted the initial perceptual registration
of the information. These results are also in line with dual-process theories that
distinguish between recollection-based and familiarity-based memory. Whereas font
reinstatement likely affected familiarity, DA seems to have affected
recollection, and the lack of interaction of the two manipulations is in line with claims
regarding the independence of these processes. Furthermore, using perceptual priming
procedures, <a href="#c20">Mulligan (1998)</a>
reached similar conclusions about the lack of DA effects on perceptual
analysis. It should be noted, however, that this lack of support for an interruption of
perceptual processes by DA at encoding is evident when implicit
measures of memory are used, as was done in the above-mentioned studies. Such processes may
still be interrupted by DA to result in a later decline in explicit
memory performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To summarize, it seems that despite the
strong detrimental effects that DA at encoding has on later memory
performance, the results obtained in the literature do not provide clear indication
regarding the identity of the processes that are interrupted during encoding by
participants' occupation with the secondary task. The current research attempted to locate
and identify the interfered processes more precisely using a new differential temporal
interference paradigm where the study phase was interrupted at different temporal segments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One reasonable assumption is that the
encoding process is not a monolithic one, but a multiphase mental activity (e.g.,
<a href="#c8">Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972</a>;
<a href="#c29">Naveh-Benjamin &amp; Jonides,
1984</a>; <a href="#c36">Tulving,
2002</a>; see also <a href="#c25">Naveh-Benjamin,
Craik, Guez, &amp; Dori, 1998</a>, and <a href="#c27">Naveh-Benjamin &amp; Guez, 2000</a> for a similar analysis
for retrieval processes). Such an activity possibly includes an initial encoding phase that
involves a perceptual registration mechanism, followed by lexical/semantic processes, and
then a more strategic phase that includes elaboration on the information initially encoded
(see <a href="#c18">Mangels, Picton, &amp; Craik,
2001</a> for a similar analysis). These processes may be supplemented by an
intentional encoding mode phase, which involves a mental set established to deliberately
encode the information, and which is active throughout the study period. Using such a
processing analysis, we wanted to evaluate whether interruption during one of these
phases/processes will result in especially poor later memory performance. To do so, we
conducted two experiments using a somewhat different DA paradigm from
the standard one, in which words to be remembered were presented along with concurrent task
interference at different temporal segments of the study phase of each word. The
interference was presented during the beginning, the middle, or the end of the study phase.
We assessed whether such differential interference would produce different degrees of
reduction in participants' later memory performance. We compared these interference
conditions to two additional ones, one where no interference was present (a full attention
condition), and the other, the standard interference condition, where interference was
presented throughout the study period.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition to looking at memory
performance, we also used an online measure that provided information about the attentional
resources required to execute each of the encoding phases. We did so by evaluating
performance on the secondary choice reaction time (CRT) task in each of
the three encoding phases relative to baseline performance when the task was performed
alone.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Manipulating the interference of the
secondary task at different phases of the study period, and measuring later memory
performance, the attentional resources required in each of these phases, as well as the
degree to which these two measures converged, could provide useful information about the
encoding phases that are especially prone to interference by a concurrent task. For example,
if the initial encoding phase is the one most affected by concurrent activity, we would
expect to have the largest decrease in later memory performance when the secondary task is
presented at an earlier phase during study. However, a more probable outcome is one where
the initial encoding phase, which is at least partially mediated by data-driven/automatic
encoding processes, is neither affected much by DA nor requires substantial attentional
resources to be completed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, if the later phases of encoding,
after the initial registration of information, were those most affected by concurrent
activity, we would expect later memory performance to be substantially affected when
concurrent activity was presented towards the middle and the later phases during study, an
effect that may be accompanied by larger attentional costs during these phases. Such a
pattern of results might point to more strategic encoding processes as those which are
especially vulnerable to concurrent task processing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To answer the above questions, we ran two
experiments in which the temporal locus of the concurrent activity during encoding was
manipulated. We measured later free recall performance as well as the attentional resources
required at encoding.</p><a id="cep-61-1-1-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_27" title="Experiment 1">Experiment 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="cep-61-1-1-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The participants were 40 Ben-Gurion

exactly 1 second, and each word was used in only one of the lists. The words in each
list were not related to each other semantically, or in any other obvious way. Nine of
the lists were studied under DA (three in each locus of
interference condition) and three appeared under full attention. The order of the
conditions and the assignment of lists to the different locus of interference conditions
were counterbalanced.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The concurrent task was a visual
continuous CRT task. It involved a visual display on a computer
screen and a manual response on a computer keyboard (see <a href="#c6">Craik et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c25">Naveh-Benjamin et al., 1998</a>). The display consisted of
four boxes arranged horizontally. An asterisk appeared at random in one of the boxes and
the participants' task was to press the corresponding key on the keyboard. A correct
response caused the asterisk to move immediately to one of the other boxes at
random.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were run individually.
During the practice phase, participants received practice with the memory task, the
concurrent task, and both together (DA). After the end of the
practice phase, participants went through 15 trials, 12 of which were memory trials that
included study and test phases, and 3 trials that involved performance on the concurrent
task alone. Three replication blocks were run with five trials in each: Four memory
trials, one under each of the four attention conditions, and one secondary task alone.
For the memory trials, participants were told to try to learn for each list as many of
the 12 words as possible and to recall as many of them as they could during the
retrieval phase. For the concurrent task alone trials, they were told to respond as fast
and as accurately as they could to each of the presented asterisks. In the
DA trials, they were told to pay equal attention to both tasks and
to try to perform on each to the best of their ability. The order of the memory trials
was counterbalanced across participants. The concurrent baseline trials were inserted
in, between the memory trials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the three full attention trials,
participants studied the 12 words for 6 seconds each (for a total of 72 seconds), and
after an interpolated activity of 30 seconds (counting backwards three-digit numbers
starting with a given number), they attempted to orally recall as many of the words as
they could for 60 seconds. Their responses were recorded by the experimenter and also
tape-recorded. The same procedure was used in the DA conditions,
except that participants encoded the words while performing the concurrent task. On
three of the memory trials, the secondary task appeared on the screen during the first 2
seconds of the study period of a given word (during the rest of the encoding period the
screen went blank). On three other memory trials, the secondary task appeared during the
middle 2 seconds of the study period, and on the three remaining trials the task
appeared during the last 2 seconds of the study period. A similar arrangement was used
for the three levels of the secondary task baseline condition, with the asterisks
appearing during the beginning, middle, or end of a given 6-second period for a total of
72 seconds for each trial.</p><a id="cep-61-1-1-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results and Discussion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Recall task</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The mean percentage of words recalled

a significant decrease in later memory performance (15% drop relative to the full
attention condition), and that encoding processes require substantial attentional
resources as reflected by the CRT task performance under
DA conditions being significantly slower than in the baseline
condition. Furthermore, the current results seem to indicate that all phases of encoding
are sensitive to interruption by a concurrent activity. However, unexpectedly, it
appears that the first phase of encoding, which is most likely associated with the
initial registration of the information, is particularly vulnerable to interference,
given that memory performance was poorest when interference happened during this phase.
In the current experiment, the four additional seconds of processing that occurred after
the interruption of the first phase were not sufficient to recover the encoding of
information to the level obtained under full attention. In addition, the encoding
activities during this phase seem to require more attentional resources than during the
other phases.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To strengthen the obtained results we
conducted a second experiment. The dual purpose of this experiment was to replicate
Experiment 1 results under somewhat different conditions and to address several issues
related to that experiment. One question regarding results obtained in Experiment 1
concerns whether or not the unexpected large interference effects on memory and greater
secondary task costs during the first study phase reflect the interruption of early
encoding/registration processes, which were presumably less mediated by strategic
processes than were subsequent phases. Since the first phase in Experiment 1 encompassed
two full seconds, it could have involved other processes, including more strategic ones.
Similarly, the smaller amount of interference shown in the third phase of encoding in
Experiment 1 might have been due to the length of the encoding phase; by the time of the
third phase after 4 seconds, encoding may have been already completed. To rule out these
possibilities, in Experiment 2, we cut by half the time allotted for each study phase
from 2 seconds to 1 second only. This resulted in each word being studied for 3 seconds
instead of the 6-second procedure implemented in Experiment 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another feature of Experiment 2 was the
employment of an additional DA condition where interference
happened throughout the study period for a given word. Having such a condition could
allow us to assess the degree to which interference during each of the phases, and
especially during the first phase, was as disruptive as that throughout the whole
encoding period.</p><a id="cep-61-1-1-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_57" title="Experiment 2">Experiment 2</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="cep-61-1-1-ID0EBBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants.

during the first phase (<em> M </em> = 491 ms) but not during the second and

to the baseline condition (<em> M </em> = 474 ms), <em>p</em> &lt;

was a significant effect of interference throughout the encoding period as indicated by
the higher CRT performance in the condition where interference
occurred during the entire 3-second encoding period (<em> M </em> = 550 ms)
relative to the appropriate 3-second baseline condition (<em> M </em> = 513 ms),
<em>p</em> &lt; .01. This result is in line with those reported in the
literature, showing that encoding processes require attentional resources.
Interestingly, the CRT performance in the condition where it was
used throughout the study period was slower than that observed for each of the specific
interference conditions (after the appropriate baselines were subtracted, providing a
measure of attentional costs), <em>p</em> &lt; .05, for Phase 1, and

CRT task in this experiment still interfered with recall
performance in Phases 2 and 3, but was not interfered with by the processes involved in
the encoding of the words during these phases, appears to suggest that these effects
reflect different aspects of processing, one pertaining to interference effects on
memory, and the other to the attentional costs required to carry out the memory
processes themselves. Although in many cases these effects show up simultaneously, there
are several cases in which they do not. For example, a process may be interrupted
without necessarily requiring greater attentional resources for its execution, such as
in cases of structural interference. Likewise, a process may not be interrupted at all,
yet still require substantial resources for its execution (See <a href="#c6">Craik et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c27">Naveh-Benjamin &amp; Guez, 2000</a>, in the
context of retrieval processes.)</p><a id="cep-61-1-1-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_82" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of both experiments converge on
similar patterns. First, both the memory and the CRT task results
replicate those reported in the literature (e.g., <a href="#c6">Craik et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c25">Naveh-Benjamin et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#c24">Naveh-Benjamin, Craik, Gavrilescu, et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#c26">Naveh-Benjamin, Craik, Perretta, et al., 2000</a>;
<a href="#c27">Naveh-Benjamin &amp; Guez,
2000</a>) in showing that DA at encoding results in a
significant decrease in later memory performance (an average drop of 20% relative to the
full attention condition), and that encoding processes require substantial attentional
resources, as reflected by the significant increase in the concurrent
CRT task during encoding relative to a baseline condition. Second, the
results of both experiments, which show that concurrent task interference at any phase of
encoding results in a significant decline in memory performance, seem to indicate that all
phases of encoding are affected by the concurrent task, from processes that happen rather
early in the study phase and processing stream, possibly associated with an initial
perceptual registration of information, to those that happen later in the study phase and
that possibly involve more strategic processes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The fact that memory performance declines
more when attention is divided throughout the encoding process than when it is divided under
each of the study phases alone (Experiment 2) may indicate that performance in the former
case is a result of the accumulation of interruptions of encoding processes at different
phases. In addition, the concomitant larger attentional costs associated with encoding when
attention is divided throughout the encoding period than those associated with each phase
alone (Experiment 2) may indicate that in addition to the attentional costs associated with
each encoding phase, there are also costs associated with processes that are operating
throughout the encoding period. The maintenance of such processes may require extra mental
effort. This interpretation is consistent with results reported by <a href="#c23">Naveh-Benjamin (2002)</a>, which demonstrated that
the attentional resources associated with intentional encoding are larger than those
required during incidental learning. This pattern can be interpreted to indicate that
entering an encoding mode, the mental state associated with preparing and maintaining
intentional encoding processes throughout the study phase, also requires sustained
attentional resources, possibly due to the need to download and maintain encoding procedures
in working memory.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results reported here are in line with
previous attempts to assess the effects of DA on various encoding
processes. As discussed in the Introduction, the attempts to pinpoint specific types of
processes as the locus of the interference effects resulted in equivocal support (e.g.,
<a href="#c7">Craik &amp; Kester, 2000</a>;
<a href="#c28">Naveh-Benjamin, Guez, &amp; Marom,
2003</a>). The current results seem compatible with the complex picture
indicated by previous results, with no one specific mechanism functioning as the sole
mediator of these DA effects. In this sense, the current studies point
to a less parsimonious and more multifaceted picture according to which
DA during encoding does not affect only one specific type of process,
but instead, seems to interfere with a multitude of encoding processes. This conclusion is
in line with results reported by <a href="#c18">Mangels, Picton,
and Craik (2001)</a>, who used an analysis of the
ERPs associated with attention during encoding and showed that the use
of a secondary task during encoding affected mostly the N340 wave, which they suggested to
represent initial lexical/semantic processes, as well as later sustained potentials from the
interaction of frontal and posterior regions, which they suggested to be related to
additional elaborative processes that happen later in the processing sequence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nevertheless, somewhat surprisingly and
unexpectedly, the current studies also demonstrate that the initial encoding phase,
tentatively associated with the initial registration of information, seems especially
vulnerable to interference: Memory performance in both experiments was poorest when
interference occurred during this phase. In addition, the encoding activities during this
phase required more attentional resources than during other encoding phases. These results
are in line with those reported by <a href="#c25">Naveh-Benjamin,
et al. (1998)</a>, which showed that time periods around the encoding of a
given word during study are associated with an increase in attentional costs compared to
periods between the words. However, the strongest interference pattern during the initial
registration phase is surprising, since the more obvious candidates for the locus of the
DA effect are those processes that follow the initial registration
and are related to strategic elaboration (<a href="#c19">Moscovitch, 1992</a>). Interestingly, this initial encoding phase seems
to be defined more in terms of relative than absolute duration, since the patterns in both
experiments were fairly similar even though the initial phase duration in Experiment 2 (1
second) was only half of that in Experiment 1 (2 seconds).<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Theoretically, there are several candidates
for the special sensitivity of the initial stage to the interruption by concurrent activity,
including novelty detection processes (<a href="#c17">Kinsbourne
&amp; George, 1974</a>; <a href="#c36">Tulving, 2002</a>; <a href="#c37">Tulving,
Markowitsch, Kapur, Habib, &amp; Houle, 1994</a>), critical initial
consolidation processes (<a href="#c36">Tulving,
2002</a>), and perceptual registration. However, in principle, these
processes are thought to be data-driven and relatively automatic in nature (e.g.,
<a href="#c19">Moscovitch, 1992</a>). As such,
we might have expected them to be somewhat resilient to interference and to be completed
with relatively little effort. It is therefore not immediately apparent how the current
results fit this characterization of initial encoding processes. One possibility may be
related to the attention model applied here. We have used a resource sharing notion within a
limited capacity model. Although this model has been used successfully in the past,
especially for characterizing overall encoding activity (e.g., <a href="#c6">Craik et al., 1996</a>), it may be better suited for the
analysis of effortful processes such as elaboration, which are involved in the later stages
of encoding processes. This model may have to be supplemented here by another model that
explains what happens during the initial encoding phase. At this phase, the appearance of
the stimuli in the secondary task (the asterisks) during the presentation of the item may
engage selection processes that divert attention away from the primary task (the auditorily
presented word) to the concurrent one, much like what happens with involuntary attention
shifts in perceptual processing (e.g., <a href="#c38">Yantis,
1993</a>). This may account for the poorer subsequent memory performance, as
some of the words may have not been encoded well in the first place. If, according to this
explanation, the execution of the secondary task becomes the first priority at this point of
processing, how may we then explain the poorer performance on the concurrent task during the
initial encoding phase? Speculatively, assuming that on some occasions a failure on one task
(the initial encoding of the word) directs one's attention back to this task (as
participants realize that they have missed hearing the word), this may result in poorer
performance on the concurrent task, as well. This catastrophic failure model, wherein
performance failure on the word encoding task triggers a re-allocation of resources to this
task and thereby results in poorer performance on the concurrent task, may explain the
pattern observed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A somewhat different but related explanation
addresses the type of attention required by both tasks. It is only during the first phase
that both the memory and the secondary CRT tasks require the same type
of exogenous attention. This is because both the auditory presentation of a word and the
sudden onset of the secondary task visual target (an asterisk) might capture the attention
of the participants, leading to poorer performance on both (see <a href="#c31">Pessoa &amp; Ungerleider, 2004</a>, for a
review).<a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup><a href="#fn3" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Alternatively, the pattern of mutual
interference during the initial phase of encoding can be explained by an interruption of
initial rehearsal (<a href="#c29">Naveh-Benjamin &amp;
Jonides, 1984</a>). Such a sensitivity of the initial study phase in the
current results is in line with the interruption of initial rehearsal hypothesis.
<a href="#c29">Naveh-Benjamin and Jonides
(1984)</a> showed that the initial rehearsals of an encoded target (in
contrast to further rehearsals) are especially important for establishing long-term memory
traces. At the same time, these rehearsals require an especially large amount of attentional
resources for their execution.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, yet another interpretation of the
larger interference and attentional cost during the first phase of encoding views these
processes as outcomes of interruption of controlled attentional processes involved in
initial word registration and acquisition. There is some evidence that controlled
attentional processes influence the speed and accuracy of low-level processes such as
stimulus detection (e.g., <a href="#c34">Schell, Wynn, Dawdson,
Sinaii, &amp; Niebala, 2000</a>), and the operation of these processes
might compete with those involved in the secondary task. Further studies are needed to
assess this less obvious possibility.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, the current work provides more
specific information on the underlying causes of the effects of DA at
encoding on later memory performance. As indicated by the measures of memory and concurrent
task performance in the two experiments, the results of which converge on similar patterns,
it seems that all phases of encoding, reflecting a multitude of processes, are affected by
the concurrent task. Although it was expected that some of these processes, such as
effortful elaboration, would be interrupted by the concurrent activity, other processes that
are associated with the initial registration of information seem, unexpectedly, to be just
as vulnerable to interference. An important task of future research will be to assess the
viability of each of the aforementioned candidates as the potential source of the initial
processing interruption by a concurrent activity, as well as elucidating the manner in which
this simultaneous activity affects the array of processes associated with encoding.</p><a id="cep-61-1-1-ID0EAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_93" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn1">1</a></sup> One potential limitation of the secondary task
costs measure in both experiments is the way in which RTs in the baseline conditions were
assessed. Since the secondary task was run in a continuous manner for the same duration as the
encoding phase but without a clear marking of the start of each new segment (comparable to the
appearance of a word in the DA conditions), it was difficult to estimate separate baseline
performance for each of the three phases. As a result, the attentional costs measure for each
phase was assessed relative to the aggregate baseline measure. It would have been desirable to
assess the cost for each phase by subtracting the RT for the specific baseline for a given
phase from the RT in this phase in the DA condition. To do so, we designed an additional
small-scale study, similar to Experiment 2, where we measured separate baseline performance at
each of the three phases (each 1-s long). We did so by presenting a beep every 3 seconds that
signified the beginning of a segment, and then introducing the secondary task during either
the first, the second, or the third second after this beep. The data for this additional
experiment show clearly that, if at all, the secondary task RT baseline for the first phase
was faster than for the other two phases, which were about equal (baseline CRTs were 344 ms,
418 ms, and 419 ms, for Phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively). This strengthens the reported
results, indicating that the attentional costs associated with the first phase are even larger
than was found in the two reported experiments.</p><a id="fn2" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn2">2</a></sup> It is interesting to note that study time and
attention seem to have independent effects at encoding. A reasonable assumption is that the
decrease in memory performance under DA at encoding is due to the time that subjects devote to
performing the secondary task, leaving less time for the processing of relevant information.
However, an ANOVA combining the results of the two current experiments with the four attention
conditions (the three DA ones, each for the different temporal phases, in addition to the full
attention one) as one factor, and experiment as the other factor (reflecting the different
times per phase in each experiment (2 sec in Experiment 1 and 1 sec in Experiment 2), showed
no interaction effect on memory performance, <em> F </em> (3, 234) = 0.35, ns (see
<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). This result seems to
suggest that reduction in memory performance under DA at encoding does not solely stem from
reduced processing time. Similar conclusions were drawn from a study using a shared time model
analysis, where <a href="#c6">Craik et al. (1996)</a>
showed that the decrease in processing time could explain only part of the deficit shown under
DA at encoding. Likewise, <a href="#c24">Naveh-Benjamin, Craik,
Gavrilescu, and Anderson (2000)</a>, using a similar shared time model
approach, showed that reduced memory performance as a result of DA at encoding was only
partially related to reduced functional time available for encoding.</p><a id="fn3" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup><a href="#b-fn3">3</a></sup> A related possible reason for the somewhat
larger interference effects during the first phase of encoding might be the fact that this is
the only phase that coincided with external stimulus presentation. For example, in Experiment
2, Phase 1 completely coincided with the 1-s long word presentation. Any significant
interference effects during this phase might be related to this aspect of the procedure rather
than to the disruption in the first phase of initial processing. One argument against this
suggestion is that such a confound may actually reflect the commonplace integration of
stimulus presentation and initial processing in everyday life situations. In spite of this
possibility, we decided to pursue this suggestion empirically by conducting an additional
small-scale study using methods similar to those employed in Experiment 2, but with an
additional condition where the word appeared for half a second before the beginning of the
secondary task, allowing for a partial nonoverlap between the appearance of the secondary task
and that of the word. Results showed that interference in Phase 1 was reduced in this
condition relative to the one shown in Phase 1 in Experiment 2. However, interference still
emerged in this phase, relative to the full attention condition. These results seem to suggest
that interference in Phase 1 reflects simultaneous external stimulus presentation in both
tasks, as well as further interruption of the initial processing of the word.</p><a id="cep-61-1-1-ID0E0HB0ABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_101" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Anderson, C.
