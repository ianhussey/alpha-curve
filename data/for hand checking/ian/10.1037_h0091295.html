Given academic psychology’s traditional adherence to a natural science model, the introduction of the cultural into psychological theorizing is, to Geertz, like mixing water and oil, trying to fit the century old, two antagonistic modes of investigation in psychology.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As is well known, <a href="#c15">Wilhelm Dilthey (1894/1977</a>, <a href="#c16">1989)</a> outlined two models of psychological investigation. A natural science model <em>(Naturwissenschaften)</em> seeks a causal explanation of a psychological phenomenon whereby the validity of a causal explanatory theory is to be examined by experimentation. A cultural science model <em>(Geistes wissenschaften)</em> seeks an understanding <em>(Verstehen)</em> of a psychological phenomenon whereby the method of investigation is hermeneutic. Whether bringing culture into psychology causes ‘noise and upheaval’ as Geertz says it does, the tension between natural science and cultural science poses significant quandaries for psychological theorizing. Traditionally, a psychological theory is charged with the task of aiding researchers to <em>predict</em> and <em>explain</em> the causal structure of psychological phenomena and to <em>interpret</em> the data within this framework. The identity of prediction, explanation, and interpretation is in fact a necessary consequence of a particular natural science model about psychological theorizing. However, when culture enters into psychological theorizing, this presumed identity among predictive, explanatory, and interpretive functions breaks down; not all psychological theories may perform the three functions, but some serve only two (prediction and interpretation). In this article, we will make a case for this thesis and explore its implications for psychology.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We first outline a <em>neo-diffusionist metatheory</em> of cultural evolution, and attempt to articulate the concept of <em>enculturated agents</em> in this perspective. We argue that the existing conceptual distinctions in psychological theories for cross-cultural comparisons, including individualism and collectivism (e.g., <a href="#c56">Triandis, 1989</a>, <a href="#c57">1996</a>), independent and interdependent self-construal (<a href="#c42">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</a>), and holistic and analytical thought systems (<a href="#c46">Nisbett, Peng, Choi, &amp; Norenzayan, 2001</a>), may not be construed as a psychological theory in the traditional sense, but as an interpretive theory, a “weaker” sense of what it means to theorize about psychological phenomena. They should not be taken to causally explain the cultural differences, or rather if they do, they do so only in a particular sense that we will outline later. Confusion about this may result in twin theoretical problems of cultural coherence and cultural causation. In the final section, we will attempt to address these theoretical quandaries by advocating two types of research programs to aid our understanding about the intersection of the psychological and the cultural: one that examines causal structures of cultural information transmission, and the other—we will call it ‘experimental semiotics’ that aids our interpretations of cultures.</p><a id="teo-27-28-2-1-234-ID0EEBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_12" title="Interpretive and Explanatory Theory">Interpretive and Explanatory Theory</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To illustrate what we mean by interpretive and explanatory theory, an example may help. 
<blockquote>In a company, a group of coworkers was responsible for completing a very important project. The project itself involved few complications, but one problem constantly plagued the group. One co-worker, who we will call ‘Z’, consistently showed up late for meetings and, worse, missed deadlines. Z had reasonable excuses for every incident. For example, in one case Z was tied up with an emergency personal situation, and in another Z came down with a bad flu. In the final analysis, Z’s work did not get done to the group’s satisfaction, and the group was often charged with the responsibilities that should have been Z’s. Group relations suffered, and the members of the group often lost their patience with Z and became sidetracked from the project. As a result of these issues, the final product did not meet expectations of quality.</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Suppose two commentators, Mr West and Mr East, made the following utterances to his respective conversational partner: Mr West Z was in charge of his own actions and behaviors.Mr East The group was unsupportive, unable to handle internal problems. In fact, the example was taken from <a href="#c45">Menon, Morris, Chiu, and Hong (1999</a>, p. 708), who reported that 41 Stanford undergraduates on the average agreed with Mr West more, and Mr East less, than their 52 counterparts at the University of Hong Kong. To simplify the matter (and suspending the potential worry of generalizing from several dozens of undergraduates to millions of Americans and Chinese!), let us suppose that, under similar circumstances, Americans are more likely to say what Mr West said, and Chinese are more likely to say what Mr East said. Then, the critical question is how psychology is to understand the cultural difference in frequency of these utterances.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An analysis of this observation helps us clarify the issue at hand. First of all, to make these utterances in response to the circumstances of Z and Z’s coworkers is to perform an action, or to perform what <a href="#c2">Austin (1962)</a> called <em>speech acts</em> (or <em>indirect</em> speech acts in contemporary linguistic pragmatics; <a href="#c38">Levinson, 1983</a>). As Austin noted, at one level, West and East are moving their mouths, contracting muscles around the vocal cord, and pushing air out, thus making the utterances, and therefore performing their <em>locutionary acts</em>. At another level, West and East are <em>blaming</em> or <em>accusing</em> Z and the group <em>in</em> saying what they said. They are <em>illocutionary acts</em>. West’s utterance has the illocutionary force of blaming Z, and East’s of blaming the group. Mr West (or Mr East) and his conversational partner would probably interpret his utterance at the level of illocutionary force.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Action, however, is notoriously difficult to describe singularly; there may be multiple descriptions of a single action (<a href="#c11">Danto, 1968</a>). Austin’s locutionary and illocutionary acts can be construed as two ways of describing the single action of uttering, “Z was in charge…” or “The group was unsupportive…”. In addition, it is possible to provide yet another type of description to the action of making these utterances. We call them <em>psychological theoretical</em> descriptions, or <em>p-theoretical</em> (or simply theoretical) descriptions for short when there is no risk of ambiguity. A p-theoretical description of an action is a description of that observable behavior within the framework of a psychological theory. So, for example, the act of saying, “Z was in charge…” may be p-theoretically described as individualistic (or independent), and the act of saying, “The group was unsupportive…” as collectivistic (or interdependent) under a certain reading of theories of individualism and collectivism (or of independent and interdependent self-construal). This is because West’s utterance blames the <em>individual,</em> but East’s blames the <em>collective</em>. Thus, to describe West’s and East’s utterances as individualistic and collectivistic, or independent and interdependent, is to make these actions intelligible within the framework of a psychological theory.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Note that a p-theoretical description is perspective-dependent, in that it is meaningful within the framework of a given psychological theory, and different p-theoretical descriptions can be given for the same action under different psychological theories. For example, suppose that Mr West gossiped with a friend before, who said something like, “So, this guy at my company took responsibility and resigned from his post. After all, he was in charge of his own action and no one else was to blame. I think that’s fair.” Let us say Mr West forgot about this conversation, and the case of Z didn’t even remind him about it. Still, according to a psychological theory of priming (and construct accessibility; e.g., <a href="#c26">Higgins, 1996</a>), this event may have primed some cognitive representations, whose activation caused Mr West’s behavior of making the utterance, “Z was in charge…”. A parallel scenario is easily conceivable for Mr East’s utterance. In either case, the action is p-theoretically described as a behavioral consequence of concept activation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These two p-theoretical descriptions of West’s and East’s utterances—individualistic or collectivistic action and behavioral consequence of concept activation—both provide <em>interpretations</em> of the action within the respective p-theoretical frameworks. Nonetheless, they differ in terms of whether they provide a <em>causal explanation</em>. The theory of concept activation <em>causally explains</em> West’s and East’s action by specifying the antecedent event (a friend’s utterance), the mediating process (activation of cognitive representations), and its consequence (their utterance making behaviors). In contrast, the theory of individualism and collectivism (as we constructed it in our example) does not specify causal antecedents or causal consequences; it nonetheless <em>interprets</em> the individual and group blaming illocutionary acts as individualistic and collectivistic acts. In our view, an explanatory theory interprets as well as explains action within a causal theory, but an interpretive theory interprets, but does not explain causally.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It should be noted that both explanatory and interpretive theories can be <em>predictive</em>. Suppose that a theory of concept activation suggests that there is a reliable probabilistic relationship between a person’s activating a certain psychological concept (such as personal or collective responsibility) in the past and using it in the future. This would be a probabilistic version of the classical Hempelian form of Deductive-Nomological explanation, or Hypothetico-Deductive prediction, a law-like conditional statement of a regularity between condition (“if” statement) and consequence (“then” statement). In contrast, suppose that there exists a theory of individualism and collectivism (or independent and interdependent self-construal), which suggests that there is a reliable probabilistic relationship between a person’s location of birth and upbringing and the person’s enactment of individualistic or collectivistic action. The logical structure is identical to that of the previous. It is just that this theory does not describe the causal structure of the psychological phenomenon, and in this sense, it is not an explanatory theory, but an interpretive theory. It nonetheless <em>can</em> predict a psychological phenomenon at hand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To describe Mr West’s (or Mr East’s) utterance as individualistic (or collectivistic) and to describe it as a behavioral consequence of priming roughly corresponds to what psychologists call the content and the process. West’s (East’s) utterance has an individualistic (collectivistic) content; the process of concept activation explains his action. However, the process-content dichotomy ontologizes what we believe is a difference in perspective; that is, the process-content terminology turns an epistemological issue into an ontological one. We believe that there do not exist two different kinds of things, process and content, but rather that they are two different kinds of descriptions of action from different kinds of p-theoretical perspectives.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, although a psychological theory has been assumed to predict, explain, and interpret, psychological theories of cultural differences may predict and interpret, but not explain, a psychological phenomenon. Note that similar arguments can be easily constructed for independent and interdependent self-construal or analytical and holistic thought systems. Under a natural science model of psychology, psychological theories have been assumed to be causal explanatory. However, when culture enters into psychological theorizing, there arises the possibility that a psychological theory may not be always explanatory, but interpretive.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At this point, a question may be raised (yes, we asked for your indulgence). Can a theory of cultural differences such as individualism and collectivism not be explanatory? We believe it can under some specific circumstances. However, an explication of such a causal explanatory reading of a theory of cultural differences needs a metatheory of culture.</p><a id="teo-27-28-2-1-234-ID0EDBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_25" title="A Neo-Diffusionist Metatheory of Culture">A Neo-Diffusionist Metatheory of Culture</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The idea that culture can be explained as diffusion of knowledge and practice is not new. In the early-20th century, a school of anthropological thoughts called diffusionism suggested that cultural knowledge and practice was created at one point somewhere, and spread elsewhere to cover the world eventually. Although this old diffusionism went out of favour, the idea that cultural information diffuses re-emerged in the 1970’s and 1980’s. We call this broad framework a neo-diffusionist metatheory of culture (e.g., <a href="#c5">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985</a>; <a href="#c6">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</a>; <a href="#c12">Dawkins, 1976</a>; <a href="#c53">Sperber, 1996</a>), which has the following common assumptions. Both genetic and cultural information contributes to human action. Cultural information is assumed to be distinct from genetic information although it may interact with the latter to produce its effects. Cultural and genetic information both travel from biological parents to a child, but only cultural information travels through other types of relationships. Thus, cultural information is transmitted not by genetic means, but by social means. Cultural information is assumed to be instantiated in a material form that can be transmitted from a person to another; it is socially learned via this transmittable form (not by some magical means of osmosis); some selective forces operate on the cultural information, so that some persist but other elements drop out (resulting in adaptation, although theories vary in terms of adaptation for whom or what); and the distribution of the cultural information within a population results in this population’s group characteristics. It does not stipulate what constitutes cultural information in this framework; it varies from one theory to another. Even within each theory, there is often no clear definition. Nonetheless, something like a belief, a value, a self-construal, or a cultural practice of some sort can all be cultural information. It suffices to assume that there exists some cultural information, and we believe this is uncontroversial.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Let us next characterize the process of cultural transmission following <a href="#c33">Kashima, Klein, and A. Clark (2007)</a>, who based their discussion on <a href="#c8">H. Clark’s (1996)</a> theory of grounding. According to Kashima et al., cultural information is transmitted within an instance of social interaction using symbols (or signs), which may occur as a central aspect of the interaction (as in explicit instructions), but more often than not, only as an incidental aspect of the joint activity (see <a href="#c52">Rogoff, 2003</a>). Here, we mean by <em>symbols</em> or <em>signs</em> some observable events including bodily movements (e.g., gestures, nonverbal behaviours) and products of behaviours (e.g., alphabets, words, etc. produced by the movements of a vocal code or written on paper by hand movements) that stand for other objects or events whose meanings are shared among the agents. In the case of explicit instructions, the to-be-transmitted cultural information is presented by an experienced cultural practitioner to a cultural learner, and the latter is expected to learn it through a variety of educational and training exercises. If cultural transmission occurs incidentally, the cultural information is embedded in the presuppositions for the central aspect of the joint activity. As the central aspect of the joint activity is carried out through the interactants’ actions, the cultural information is implied by those actions. At any rate, the interactants’ joint activity is carried out collaboratively, in a socially coordinated manner, and incompletely—it occurs to the extent necessary for the current purpose of carrying out the joint activity. This process of sharing cultural information through collaborative activities is called <em>grounding</em>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a consequence of the agents’ grounding cultural information in social interaction, that cultural information is represented in the agents who engaged in this interaction. By representation, we mean broadly the agents’ internal state (perhaps their bodily and neural activities), akin to <a href="#c14">Dietrich and Markman (2000)</a>. We do not intend to imply a physical entity manipulated by a central processing unit as in the von Neumann computing machine metaphor. It should be read as a short hand for an emergent property of the dynamics of the agents’ embodied cognitive systems, which may be better described as <em>representing</em> in the gerundival form. Two consequences follow. First of all, the representations of the cultural information are not identical across those agents. One agent may hold some of the information, but another may represent only some other aspects of it, still another may present partially overlapping, but different aspects of the cultural information, and so on. In other words, the cultural information is likely to be <em>distributed</em> across the people (e.g., <a href="#c27">Hutchins, 1995</a>). We call this <em>interpersonally distributed cognition</em>. Secondly, we take the view that each agent’s representation of the cultural information takes a <em>distributed form</em> within the person, which is modelled by a connectionist architecture of parallel distributed processing (e.g., <a href="#c34">Kashima, Woolcock, &amp; Kashima, 2000</a>). That is, a representation is understood as activating or deactivating of numerous simple processing units, which individually follow simple input-output rules, but collectively perform surprisingly complex information processing tasks. Different representational contents are indicated by different patterns of activation of these units; one representation may mean the activation of some units, but the deactivation of others, whereas another representation may mean the activation of some other units, and so on. For an example of an attempt to model a pragmatist conception of dynamic and embodied self-processes, see <a href="#c32">Kashima, Gurumurthy, Ouschan, Chong, and Mattingley (2007)</a>. Let us call this <em>intrapersonally distributed cognition</em>. Cultural information then is likely <em>doubly distributed</em> across and within people (<a href="#c31">Kashima, 2004</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An agent participates in particular interaction episodes such as these with a variety of other agents in various contexts over time. It is expected that each agent would encounter numerous social interaction episodes in which given cultural information is grounded, thus cumulating over time distributed representations of this cultural information. Although only a subset of the cultural information’s components may be represented at a time, an increasingly greater subset of the cultural information is likely stored in this agent. The result of a history of such particular interaction episodes over the agent’s life span up to a certain point in time is the agent’s cultural knowledge at the time. We call <em>enculturated agents</em> those who have cumulated cultural information in the past in the sense we described here, and continue to cumulate more cultural information in the future. It is these cumulated distributed representations that are <em>causally</em> implicated in the enculturated and enculturating agents’ subsequent psychological processes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Note that the neo-diffusionist metatheory and grounding processes as we outlined here have a number of similarities with various existing philosophical and theoretical approaches such as pragmatist traditions of social theorizing (e.g., <a href="#c44">Mead, 1934</a>), <a href="#c51">Ricoeur’s (1979)</a> phenomenological hermeneutics, <a href="#c21">Habermas’s (1987)</a> critical theory, and the activity theoretic concept of practice as theorists inspired by Vygotsky and Bakhtin would use it (e.g., <a href="#c10">Cole, 1996</a>; <a href="#c37">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</a>; <a href="#c59">Wertsch, 1991</a>). <a href="#c33">Kashima, Klein, and Clark (2007)</a> briefly discuss the relationship of the current approach to these other existing approaches. What clearly distinguishes our conceptualization from them is the recognition of the intrapersonal distributed representations, which is a significant point of departure as we will see later.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Note that the transmitted cultural information is assumed to be describable using the symbols available to the agents engaged in the social interaction episode, but it may not in fact be so described by these agents in this particular episode. This theoretical description of cultural information is akin to what is typically known as an <em>emic</em> description, namely, a theoretical description of the cultural information using symbols shared among the enculturated agents, and we will use the term, emic, in this sense. However, our metatheoretical perspective suggests that even emicly described cultural information is not necessarily represented by an agent uniformly or identically, but it may be the case that represented idiosyncratically, individual differences are a part and parcel of a doubly distributed representational scheme.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Let us use the earlier example of Mr West’s utterance to illustrate how the neo-diffusionist metatheory works. Suppose that Mr West gossiped with a friend who works for a different company, who said something like, “So, this guy at my company took responsibility and resigned from his post. After all, he was in charge of his own action and no one else was to blame. I think that’s fair.” Later on, when Mr West was gossiping about the recent incident involving Z with his colleague at a water cooler in their company, Mr West made the utterance, “Z was in charge of his own actions and behaviours.” In this example, Mr West’s first encounter with his friend at a different company is one cultural transmission episode, and his water cooler conversation with his colleague is another. Mr West may have encoded the first episode as an incident that exemplifies the importance of “personal responsibility,” “being in charge of his own actions,” and that people should take responsibility for their own actions. “Personal responsibility” is an emic concept, whose component is “being in charge of his own actions.” This episode including this emic concept and its component is represented in Mr West in a distributed manner. Later on, when Mr West encounters another situation in which someone’s responsibility is at issue, he represents it as the issue of “personal responsibility” and then makes the utterance, “Z was in charge of his own actions and behaviours.”</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mr East’s utterance, “The group was unsupportive, unable to handle internal problems,” works equally well. Replace Mr West’s friend’s utterance with Mr East’s friend’s following utterance, “The coworkers of this guy at my company were so unsupportive that they didn’t even help him. Anyhow, their superior held the whole group responsible for it. I think that’s fair.” And replace “personal responsibility” with Mr East’s emic concept, something like “rentai sekinin” in Japanese, which is roughly translated as “collective responsibility.” Then, the example works in much the same way, but let us persist with Mr West.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Note that these examples help us further clarify the difference between explanatory and interpretive p-theories. On the one hand, Mr West’s action can be described in terms of neo-diffusionist explanatory theory as a series of cultural transmission episodes. Mr West’s friend transmits to Mr West a piece of cultural information, which can be described by the <em>emic</em> concept “personal responsibility.” Mr West represents it in his distributed representational system, and then Mr West transmits the cultural information “personal responsibility” to his colleague at the water cooler. The causal process is a sequence of communication-distributed cognitive representation-communication. Two points are noteworthy in this explanation. First, it is concepts describable by the emic concept, “personal responsibility” (or “rentai sekinin” in the case of Mr East) that is involved in the causal explanation. It is still possible that no emic concept is used to represent this episode, and it may be a lower-level verbal behaviour (e.g., locutionary act per se) or bodily movement that is represented in the agent. In this case, even the emic concept is not causally involved, but rather an <em>emic practice</em> (i.e., a type of behaviour describable by an emic concept) is causally implicated. Second, it is Mr West’s distributed cognitive representations that are causally involved in this explanation of Mr West’s action.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On the other hand, it is possible to describe Mr West’s action in the interpretive p-theory of individualism and collectivism. Mr West’s action is describable as individualistic (Mr East’s as collectivistic); however, “individualistic” (or “collectivistic”) is not an <em>emic</em> concept that Mr West (or Mr East), or their ordinary communication partners typically use to represent the cultural transmission episode. Rather, it is an <em>etic</em> concept that is constructed in this psychological theory to describe a social action such as Mr West’s (and Mr East’s) utterances. Therefore, the concept of “individualism” or “individualistic” is <em>not</em> causally involved in the process of cultural transmission, and therefore does not provide a causal explanation for it. The concept of “individualism” (or “collectivism”) provides an interpretation of Mr West’s (or Mr East’s) action.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This is not to say the concepts of “individualism” or “collectivism” can never provide a causal explanation. One possible way involves the cultural transmission of these etic concepts (see <a href="#c20">Gergen, 1973</a>). If Mr West has taken a course in cultural psychology and learned these concepts, and uses them in his daily lives, and if Mr West’s friends and acquaintances have learned them from him and use them in their conversations, this may be involved in the causal process of cultural transmission. However, in this situation, Mr West and his friends have turned an etic concept into an emic one. In other words, neo-diffusionist metatheory suggests that emic concepts may be causally involved in cultural transmission, but etic concepts would not be unless they are turned into emic ones by teaching, education, and further transmission.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In sum, cultural information is transmitted from one agent to another in particular instances of social interaction among enculturated agents within their joint activities in concrete contexts. The process of grounding, in which cultural information is transmitted through collaborative processes, results in the distribution of the cultural information between the agents (interpersonally distributed cognition), who in turn represent it in a distributed representational system (intrapersonally distributed cognition). Thus it is doubly distributed between and within enculturated agents. We suggested that the grounded cultural information may be describable by emic concepts, concepts that are describable using the symbols shared among the enculturated agents, and that encoded cultural information may differ from one agent to another although it may still be describable by emic concepts. However, we also suggested that distributed representations of the learned information may be more idiosyncratic, and may not be emicly describable. It is those doubly distributed representations that psychological processes causally engage with, and that are therefore relevant for a causal explanatory p-theory. However, most interpretive p-theories provide an interpretive p-theoretical description of those distributed representations, not by emic concepts, but by etic concepts, which are usually describable only by the symbols that the agents do not share.</p><a id="teo-27-28-2-1-234-ID0ECBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_40" title="Psychological Implications of Neo-Diffusionist Metatheory">Psychological Implications of Neo-Diffusionist Metatheory</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We can now clarify the implications of interpretive p-theories under the neo-diffusionist metatheory. One of the critical insights of the neodiffusionist metatheory constructed in this article is that <em>psychological processes that involve interpersonally and intrapersonally distributed cultural information are embedded in the causal structure of the joint activities in which the cultural information is used</em>. The cultural information is both emicly and eticly describable. However, only emic concepts may be (although even they may not be) involved in the causal flow of the events in the joint activities, and etic concepts do not. The confusion of etic and emic concepts, and their respective causal relevance, results in two theoretical issues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">First is the issue of <em>cultural coherence</em>. An interpretive p-theory can predict that people from different cultural backgrounds show differences in multiple psychological processes, which are theoretically describable by the etic construct of interest such as individualism. However, measures of these multiple psychological processes may not form a coherent psychological construct. That is, an etic concept may be used to interpret multiple emic concepts that describe the relevant psychological processes observed in a given culture. Each of the psychological processes may be validly observed by using a procedure purported to measure it, and the putative measures of these psychological processes may empirically exhibit the predicted cultural differences. Nonetheless, these putative measures may not correlate across people within each culture, suggesting that these psychological processes do not form a coherent underlying psychological construct, but rather disparate ones embedded in different causal structures of the world. To put it simply, the problem of cultural coherence is that psychological processes that do not cohere across individuals (i.e., uncorrelated individual differences) may show generally consistent cultural differences that are interpretable under an interpretive p-theory. When <a href="#c57">Triandis (1996)</a> characterized individualism and collectivism as cultural <em>syndromes,</em> he was alluding to this issue.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">How would the neo-diffusionist metatheory suggest this possibility? Here is one scenario. Suppose that there are emic concepts (e.g., personal responsibility and rentai sekinin or collective responsibility) interpreted by etic concepts (e.g., individualism and collectivism), which are used in different contexts (e.g., work team, friendship group, and family). The way in which the emic concept (e.g., personal responsibility) is used, talked about, and culturally transmitted in the family setting may be quite different from that in other social settings. In other words, in one class of contexts such as families where joint activities take place among parents, children, and close relatives, the emic concept may be often associated with one set of components, whereas it may be more often associated with another set of components in a different class of contexts where different joint activities take place among friends or workmates. Indeed, that is what <a href="#c50">Rhee, Uleman, and Lee (1996)</a> found in the United States and Korea. A set of social actions and joint activities that are eticly describable as individualistic (or collectivistic) in the context involving families and relatives (kin) turned out to form a latent variable empirically separate from another latent variable for those in the non-kin contexts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another possibility is the following. An etic concept may be used to interpret multiple emic concepts. Each of them is used in interaction episodes in a certain domain of joint activities. However, if the joint activities that engage one emic concept or practice, those that engage another, and those that engage still another are all different, these different emic concepts and practices that are describable by the same etic concept may be involved in different psychological processes, which are all embedded in different causal structures of socio-cultural joint activities. For instance, the etic concept of holism may be used to describe two or more psychological processes, which are described by different emic concepts. One may be a tendency to expect a change in trend (e.g., when an upward trend is expected to change to a downward trend; <a href="#c28">Ji, Nisbett, &amp; Su, 2001</a>), and the other may be tolerance of contradiction (<a href="#c48">Peng &amp; Nisbett, 1999</a>). They may be both eticly describable as “holistic” because they rest on the underlying ontological assumption that contradictory forces, which make up the whole, operate on events. The expectation of a change stems from the belief that even if one force is producing a current trend (e.g., upward), a contradictory force may come into play to change the trend (i.e., downward). The contradiction tolerance embodies the view that two contradictory forces are both in operation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nonetheless, when <a href="#c7">Choi, Koo, and Choi (2007)</a> developed measures of the two tendencies, they found that they formed largely uncorrelated, psychological constructs, and yet showed systematic cultural differences between Korea and the US. Although arguably the same ontological assumption may underlie the two tendencies, it is quite possible that the joint activities that engage the change expectation and those that involve the contradiction tolerance are quite distinct. The former may occur when people are talking about their future, whereas the latter may be a part of conversations about the past. Different task requirements may engage different types of conversations in these occasions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to the neo-diffusionist metatheory, an episode of cultural transmission is typically context specific and takes place within the agents’ joint activities (i.e., cultural information is taught or learned while the agents do things together in a specific context), and therefore, an emic concept and practice is learned within the joint activities in which the enculturated agents are engaged. This implies that if the joint activities that take place while a certain emic concept is used are different from those for another emic concept (or the same concept in a different context), these emic concepts do not have to have the same associated components. In fact, if the joint activities are different for different emic concepts (or the same emic concept in different contexts), they are likely to be represented differently from each other. This is an implication of the assumption that much of the cultural transmission takes place within particular social interaction episodes of specific joint activities in concrete contexts. Furthermore, individual enculturated agents may acquire only a subset of the total components for an emic concept and practice (e.g., one agent may have acquired some of its components, but another may have acquired some other only partly overlapping components, and so on). Even if there is some overlap in represented components of the same emic concept and practice in different contexts or different emic concepts and practices, the overlap may not be large. These are the implications of the interpersonally distributed cognition, the notion that a cultural concept is represented not uniformly, but in a distributed manner among its members. The upshot of these arguments is that the putative measures of the psychological processes involving these emic concepts that are describable by the same etic concept may not correlate with each other within a culture. Yet, the lack of correlation does not imply that the etic concept lacks merit; it can still serve the predictive and interpretive functions of psychological theories.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nonetheless, the frequencies of the use of the relevant emic concepts and practices may be reliably different between cultural groups, so that the cultural differences may be observed on the measures that tap the processes describable by these emic concepts, which are nonetheless uncorrelated across individual enculturated agents. As Latané and his colleagues (<a href="#c35">Latané, 1996</a>; <a href="#c36">Latané &amp; L’Herrou, 1996</a>) suggested, due to frequencies of interaction among enculturated agents who are spatially close to each other, and relative absence of interaction between agents who are spatially apart, there may emerge spatially separate clusters of joint activities in distant geographical areas. This suggests that two or more joint activities that involve or are describable by different emic concepts could occur prevalently in two distant geographical regions typically regarded as different cultures. However, there may be no theoretically meaningful relationship between one emic concept and another (or cultural practices describable by the emic concepts). Although other processes may generate reliable cultural group differences in the absence of cultural coherence, we will not explore them further here.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A second issue that arises from the confusion of emic and etic concepts is the problem of <em>cultural causation</em>. That is, the etic concepts in an interpretive p-theory used to predict cultural differences in psychological processes may not be causally implicated in those psychological processes. For instance, one may predict that in cultures where an independent self-construal is prevalent, a certain psychological process is likely to occur (e.g., fundamental attribution error), but it does not occur as often in cultures where an interdependent self-construal is prevalent. The traditional causal model of cultural differences in psychological processes suggests that cultural membership of the participants is a distal cause, and the etic cultural construct used to predict the cultural difference (independent and interdependent self-construal in this case) is a proximal cause, of the psychological process for which the cultural difference is found. Under this model, measures of the etic construct used to predict the cultural difference (i.e., self-construal) should be able to account for the cultural difference in the statistical sense. When this putative measure of the etic constructs is statistically controlled for, the cultural difference on the criterion variable should become statistically non-significant. However, as <a href="#c43">Matsumoto’s (1999)</a> review found, this statistical prediction was not borne out in a number of cases, suggesting that measures arguably of independent and interdependent self-construals based on paper and pencil tasks could not statistically account for the predicted cultural differences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The problem may stem from the possibility that the self-construal measure and the measure of the psychological process do not tap into sufficiently similar representations. On the one hand, a task used to measure the psychological process typically requires the agent to use his or her own experiences of performing tasks that are similar to that task. In other words, the memory representations used to perform the psychological task are likely to be specific to the type of task at hand. On the other hand, the task required by paper and pencil measures of self-construal taps into representations that are not specific to <em>any</em> tasks, so that responses to such measures are unlikely to reflect task-specific experiences. To make the matter more concrete, it may help to discuss this in a specific model of distributed representational system (<a href="#c34">Kashima, Woolcock, &amp; Kashima, 2000</a>). According to this model, a self-construal measure can be thought of as a form of recognition task, in which a self-referential statement is used as a cue to access the intrapersonal distributed representations. If an enculturated agent has frequently interpreted his or her actions in the way the self-referential statement describes, the greater would be the “resonance” of the distributed representations without specific references to the context in which the agent had these experiences. In this sense, self-construal measures may reflect the enculturated agent’s global life-long experience across all contexts, whereas the task to measure the psychological process likely relies on the agent’s task specific experience. Because the cognitive bases on which the self-construal and the psychological process tasks are performed may be different, the agents’ performances on them may not correlate with each other.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All in all, in our view, most psychological theories about cultural differences are best viewed as interpretive theories, rather than explanatory ones. The confusion of interpretive p-theories as explanatory results in the problems of cultural coherence and cultural causation. They are byproducts of failing to recognize that it is the emic concepts and practices that are likely involved in the joint activities that enculturated agents engage in, rather than the etic concepts per se, that are likely implicated in the causal structure of the psychological processes of interest. By more closely attending to the typical lived experience of the joint activities involved in cultural transmission, and methodologically tuning in to the emic concepts and practices used in those joint activities, interpretive p-theories may be able to provide better guidance for cultural psychological investigation.</p><a id="teo-27-28-2-1-234-ID0EBBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_53" title="Two Research Programs: Cultural Transmission and Experimental Semiotics">Two Research Programs: Cultural Transmission and Experimental Semiotics</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The foregoing discussion suggests that there can be two distinct research programs. One is an <em>explanatory research program,</em> aiming at examining the causal structure of cultural information transmission. Its main objective is to construct causal explanatory theories of the transmission and acquisition, intrapersonal and interpersonal distribution, and micro-level behavioral and other macro-level implications of cultural information. Evolutionary psychologists (e.g., <a href="#c55">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1992</a>) wish to provide explanations about the evolutionary bases on which cultures are generated and transmitted. Some cultural anthropologists (e.g., <a href="#c53">Sperber, 1996</a>) wish to explain the causal processes by which cultural information is transmitted and self-organize. Vygotsky inspired developmental psychologists to examine the causal processes involved in cultural teaching and learning in childhood socialization processes (e.g., <a href="#c52">Rogoff, 2003</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One example of this program makes use of the method of serial reproduction in which cultural information is given to a person, who in turn reproduces it from memory for a second person, who in turn reproduces it for a third, and so on. The method resembles the party game of Chinese Whispers, and originally used by <a href="#c3">Bartlett (1932)</a> and later adopted by <a href="#c1">Allport and Postman (1947)</a>. Bartlett in particular described the process as one of conventionalization, in which cultural information unfamiliar to the participants is eventually assimilated into a form that is familiar to them. So, when a Native American story of the War of the Ghosts is given to Cambridge students in the early 20th century, as it traveled through the transmission chains a canoe was changed to a boat, a black thing that came out of the mouth was modified to the spirit, and so on, generally making the unconventional into conventional (see <a href="#c29">Kashima, 2000a</a>, for a review of Bartlett’s cultural psychology). More recently, Kashima and his colleagues (e.g., <a href="#c30">Kashima, 2000b</a>; <a href="#c41">Lyons &amp; Kashima, 2003</a>) adopted the method to examine the transmission of a story that embeds information that is consistent or inconsistent with cultural stereotypes. They generally showed that stereotype-consistent information is more likely to be transmitted than stereotype-inconsistent information in the long run, suggesting that there is a general tendency towards cultural maintenance once cultural information such as stereotypes is widely shared. Even if stereotype-inconsistent information is sometimes better reproduced than stereotype-consistent information early on, presumably due to the surprising nature of the former, this is typically reversed, so that more stereotype-consistent than inconsistent information is likely retained later in the cultural transmission chains (<a href="#c30">Kashima, 2000b</a>). <a href="#c9">Clark and Kashima (in press)</a> have shown that this bias in cultural transmission is likely driven by people’s motivation to socially bond with their audiences, suggesting a strongly social basis of the tendency for cultural maintenance (for a review, see <a href="#c33">Kashima, Klein, &amp; Clark, 2007</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The other possibility is an <em>interpretive research program,</em> aiming at interpreting the cultural information being transmitted. Its main objective is to construct interpretive theories of the cultural information transmitted and learned, distributed across and within people, and presumably influencing micro-behaviors and macro-processes. We believe that much of the investigation of cultural differences in psychological processes may be best understood as research within interpretive research programs using quantitative and experimental methodology. We shall call the experimental variant of the interpretive research program <em>experimental semiotics,</em> an experimental investigation of meaningful symbols and signs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An example of this research centers on the concept of <em>human</em> or <em>person</em>. <a href="#c54">Strawson (1959)</a> declared that the concept of <em>person</em> is a conceptual primitive, which is not reducible to other concepts. Whether it is indeed a primitive in that sense, the concept of person is widely acknowledged to exist in some recognizable form in all human societies (e.g., <a href="#c18">Geertz, 1983</a>). Both <a href="#c56">Triandis (1989)</a> and <a href="#c42">Markus and Kitayama (1991)</a> approvingly referred to <a href="#c18">Geertz’s (1983)</a> well known quote on the Western conception of the person, although their theorizing was generally concerned about self-concepts, signalling the theoretical importance of the concept of person in their theories. However, it was Leyens and his colleagues (e.g., <a href="#c39">Leyens, et al., 2000</a>; for a review, see <a href="#c13">Demoulin et al., 2004</a>) who more recently refocused the theoretical attention on person in general, rather than <em>self,</em> by examining people’s conception of humanness. In particular, according to their research, people believe that one of the properties that humans have, but other animals do not, is our capacity to feel secondary emotions or <em>sentiment,</em> sophisticated emotional experiences such as the feeling of pride, nostalgia, guilt, and resentment. What is most intriguing in their research program is people’s tendency to deny the human ability to experience both positive and negative secondary emotions to their outgroup others. Dubbed infrahumanization, this tendency was widely found and shown to have automatic and behavioural correlates (<a href="#c58">Vaes et al., 2003</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Following this tradition, Haslam and his colleagues (e.g., <a href="#c22">Haslam, 2006</a>; <a href="#c23">Haslam, Bain, Douge, Lee, &amp; Bastian, 2005</a>; <a href="#c24">Haslam, Bain, Loughnan, &amp; Kashima, in press</a>) suggested that there are not just one, but at least two clusters of human properties that are central to our conceptions of humanness. One centers on the human abilities to think and intend, and also the capacity to experience the more cognitively sophisticated secondary emotions, which Leyens and his colleagues examined (i.e., uniquely human properties). In addition, there is another cluster of human properties that define human nature, the human abilities to feel (not just secondary, but also primary) emotions and also to wish, want, and desire (<a href="#c25">Haslam, Kashima, et al., in press</a>). If the uniquely human properties distinguish humans from animals, the naturally human properties set humans apart from robots, machines, and other artifacts. This research program has found that people distinguish uniquely human and naturally human properties (e.g., <a href="#c23">Haslam et al., 2005</a>), that people tend to attribute naturally human properties to themselves relative to average others (<a href="#c23">Haslam et al., 2005</a>), and that values that are naturally human (i.e., innately driven) are seen to be more important and unable to be traded off with other values (<a href="#c4">Bain, Kashima, &amp; Haslam, 2006</a>). Furthermore, using an experimental method to measure implicit associations, <a href="#c40">Loughnan and Haslam (2007)</a> showed that Australians implicitly associate businessmen, who are seen to have more uniquely human and less naturally human properties, with automata, but artists, who are seen to have more naturally human but fewer uniquely human properties, with animals. Intriguingly, consistent with an interpretive anthropologist, <a href="#c47">Ortner’s (1974)</a> theory that women are likened to nature, and men, to culture, <a href="#c49">Reynolds and Haslam (2007)</a> found that the concept of women is implicitly more closely associated with animals and naturally human properties, and less closely associated with machines, than the concept of men. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is our contention that both qualitative/idiographic and quantitative methods are useful in pursuing an interpretive research program. We surmise, however, that experimental semiotic approaches are more amenable to the neo-diffusionist metatheory as we outlined above. First, the issue of the interpersonal distribution of cultural information within a population is more amenable to statistical treatment. When researchers wish to characterize a group’s culture, one way to do so is to use a central tendency of the distribution of given cultural information within this group. It may be the mode, median, or mean. Depending on how the cultural information is conceptualized and measured, different types of statistical treatments may be more suitable. This discussion may remind some readers of the old question of “modal personality” in the heyday of culture and personality research. Their solution then was to regard individual people as the unit of analysis, to characterize each individual in terms of certain personality dimensions, and to use the mode of the distribution over a dimension. The problem was, however, that they could not find a mode that corresponded with their theoretical analysis. In the current neo-diffusionist metatheory, however, the unit of analysis is not necessarily individuals, but at least, in theory, particular interaction episodes for joint activities. Whether this approach fares any better is a question only future research can answer.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, the intrapersonal distribution of cultural information is an issue that idiographic approaches may have some difficulty handling. Idiographic methodology is designed to tap emic concepts and practices; if cultural information is idiosyncratically coded, but accessible to an individual’s introspection, then introspection may be used to investigate it. However, if cultural information is implicit and represented in an intrapersonally distributed fashion, this is likely to pose a problem for idiographic methods. Obvious alternative research methodologies include some measures of implicit associations, and neuroscience methods such as fMRI and TMS. A less obvious possibility may be the use of computer simulations of distributed cognitive processes to capture the nature of the representation of cultural information (<a href="#c32">Kashima, Gurmurthy, et al., 2007</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, experimental semiotics has an advantage for psychology because of its methodological congruity with its traditional disciplinary strengths. Psychology adopted the natural science model of human science, and rigorously pursued quantitative methods as an integral aspect of the disciplinary training. Psychologists’ standard methodological armament includes parametric and nonparametric statistical methods and computer software to treat the data. To the extent that the quantitative methodological route is pursued to construct an interpretive psychological theory, the concept of culture may not cause the ‘noise and upheaval’ that Geertz predicted in psychology, but more a challenge and enrichment.</p><a id="teo-27-28-2-1-234-ID0EABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_64" title="Concluding Comments">Concluding Comments</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Geertz was right in reminding us of the deep epistemological and methodological rift between natural science and cultural science models of human sciences. His warning does strike a chord, and within the all encompassing joint activities of psychological investigations, an unreflective use of the concepts and practices of measurement, experimentation, and quasi-experimental methods of cross-cultural comparison may indeed be problematic. If we conceptualize the phenomenon of human culture in some available metatheoretical light, theoretical quandaries like cultural coherence and cultural causality may become intelligible, and the experimental and quantitative methods in psychology can become a useful part of psychology as a human science. Under the emerging contemporary metatheory of culture, bringing the concept of culture into psychology is perhaps not as radical as Geertz thought it was.</p><a id="teo-27-28-2-1-234-ID0E02B0AAAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_68" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Allport, G.
