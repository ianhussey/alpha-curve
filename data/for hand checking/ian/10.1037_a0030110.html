Job demands can be defined as work-related tasks that require effort and vary from solving complex problems via dealing with aggressive clients to moving heavy objects. Job resources are work-related assets (i.e., opportunities, data, people, things) that can be employed to deal with those job demands. Examples of job resources are job autonomy, emotional support from colleagues and supervisors, or technical equipment. Generally speaking, three specific types of job demands and job resources can be distinguished: cognitive, emotional, and physical demands and resources (<a href="#c21">Hockey, 2000</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several researchers have pointed out the stress-buffering effect of job resources, indicating that high job demands will result in job strain unless workers have sufficient job resources to deal with their demanding job (e.g., <a href="#c13">Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, &amp; Schaufeli, 2001</a>; <a href="#c23">Karasek, 1979</a>; <a href="#c31">Siegrist, 1996</a>). One approach in job stress research has taken this proposition a step further by suggesting that workers are least likely to experience job strain if they have access to sufficient and, particularly, <em>corresponding</em> types of job resources to deal with their job demands (e.g., <a href="#c8">Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985</a>; <a href="#c9">Cutrona &amp; Russell, 1990</a>; <a href="#c38">Viswesvaran, Sanchez, &amp; Fisher, 1999</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More recently, the ideas of specificity and correspondence or match have been integrated into the demand-induced strain compensation (DISC) model (<a href="#c11">de Jonge &amp; Dormann, 2003</a>, <a href="#c12">2006</a>). According to the DISC model, workers who are faced with high physical job demands (e.g., moving heavy objects) are least likely to experience job strain if they have access to sufficient physical job resources (e.g., a trolley). In a similar vein, it is proposed that workers who are faced with high cognitive job demands (e.g., solving complex problems) are least likely to experience job strain if they have access to sufficient cognitive job resources (e.g., information from handbooks). Finally, workers who are confronted with high emotional job demands (e.g., taking care of dying patients) are least likely to experience job strain when they have access to sufficient emotional job resources (e.g., emotional support from colleagues; (<a href="#c11">de Jonge &amp; Dormann, 2003</a>, <a href="#c12">2006</a>). This idea of correspondence or match is referred to as the “matching hypothesis” (cf. <a href="#c7">Cohen &amp; McKay, 1984</a>; <a href="#c12">de Jonge &amp; Dormann, 2006</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Up until now, there has been a growing body of empirical evidence for the DISC model's matching hypothesis (<a href="#c10">Daniels &amp; de Jonge, 2010</a>; <a href="#c36">van den Tooren, de Jonge, &amp; Dormann, 2011</a>), implying that employers should make matching job resources (i.e., job resources that match job demands) available to workers. However, most research on the DISC model relies heavily on self-reports (i.e., survey data) and has been criticized for its sample selection bias. For instance, a recent overview of the DISC model revealed that research on the model has been mainly conducted among service employees—in particular, health care workers (<a href="#c36">van den Tooren, de Jonge, &amp; Dormann, 2011</a>). As a result, many studies on the DISC model might have been affected by common method bias and a limited generalizability of results. In addition to these methodological limitations of DISC research, a recent vignette study by <a href="#c34">van den Tooren and de Jonge (2010)</a> showed that although people are generally inclined to use matching job resources, they are also inclined to use nonmatching job resources, that is, job resources that do not correspond to the type of job demands concerned. For instance, people may mobilize emotional support from colleagues as a job resource for cognitive demands. As nonmatching job resources have proven to be less functional resources than matching job resources in dealing with specific types of demanding work situations (<a href="#c36">van den Tooren, de Jonge, &amp; Dormann, 2011</a>), the activation of nonmatching job resources could have serious implications for both theory (e.g., weak support for the stress-buffering effect of job resources) and practice (e.g., unsuccessful job redesign). These effects are particularly likely to manifest themselves when people use nonmatching job resources as a <em>substitute</em> for matching job resources (cf. <a href="#c19">Hobfoll, 2001</a>; <a href="#c20">Hobfoll &amp; Lerman, 1989</a>), for instance, because they believe that matching job resources are not sufficiently powerful to deal with the type of job demands concerned. In contrast, if people use nonmatching job resources as a <em>supplement</em> to matching job resources to compensate for the lack of fit between capacity and demand (cf. <a href="#c19">Hobfoll, 2001</a>; <a href="#c40">Westman, Hobfoll, Chen, Davidson, &amp; Laski, 2005</a>), the use of nonmatching job resources could work out favorably. The activation of nonmatching job resources may thus have a different impact on both theory and practice, depending on whether it concerns resource substitution or resource supplementation. Although the vignette study by <a href="#c34">van den Tooren and de Jonge (2010)</a> revealed that people are sometimes inclined to use nonmatching job resources, there was no information on the issue of resource substitution or resource supplementation. To the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on the extent to which people choose nonmatching job resources as a substitute for matching job resources and as a supplement to matching job resources. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to investigate the choices people make regarding the investment of matching and nonmatching job resources in different demanding work situations. In line with the study by <a href="#c34">van den Tooren and de Jonge (2010)</a>, the present study has an experimental design with vignettes. However, whereas <a href="#c34">van den Tooren and de Jonge (2010)</a> included a sample of health care workers in their study, the current study was conducted among undergraduates. By means of the experimental design and this unique sample, we hope to account for the common method bias and sample selection bias that might have affected previous research on the DISC model.</p><a id="str-19-4-311-ID0EDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_13" title="FUNCTIONAL HOMEOSTATIC REGULATION THEORY">FUNCTIONAL HOMEOSTATIC REGULATION THEORY</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The DISC model has been theoretically based on functional homeostatic regulation theory (e.g., <a href="#c36">van den Tooren, de Jonge, &amp; Dormann, 2011</a>). According to this theory, an explanation for why people are generally inclined to use matching job resources is that they strive for functional homeostasis (cf. <a href="#c4">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1982</a>, <a href="#c5">1998</a>; <a href="#c14">Edwards, 1998</a>). Consider, for instance, a worker who is confronted with a physically strenuous task (e.g., moving heavy objects). As this task requires a lot of physical efforts, the worker may gradually become physically exhausted. At the moment the worker experiences a discrepancy or an imminent discrepancy between his or her current physical condition and normal physical condition (i.e., reference value), s/he will come into action to reduce this discrepancy (<a href="#c6">Carver &amp; Scheier, 2000</a>). That is, the worker will mobilize job resources to deal with the demanding situation at work concerned. Through lifelong learning processes that bear most resemblance to operant conditioning (<a href="#c32">Skinner, 1969</a>), workers have learned that homeostasis can best be strived for through the use of matching job resources. In the current example, this means that the worker will mobilize physical job resources (e.g., a trolley). This type of job resources is considered most effective because physical job resources provide the physical “energy” that is needed to deal with the physically strenuous task (i.e., moving heavy objects; cf. <a href="#c30">Quinn, Spreitzer, &amp; Lam, 2012</a>). Cognitive job resources and emotional job resources provide other types of “energy” and are therefore less suited to deal with physical job demands. Instead, these specific types of job resources are best suited to deal with job demands that require cognitive effort and emotional effort, respectively. As a result, people are generally inclined to use cognitive job resources to deal with cognitive job demands, emotional job resources to deal with emotional job demands, and physical job resources to deal with physical job demands.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We already mentioned before that although people seem to have a strong preference for matching job resources, they also are inclined to use less functional nonmatching job resources (<a href="#c34">van den Tooren &amp; de Jonge, 2010</a>). Nonmatching job resources can be used either as a substitute for matching job resources (e.g., if people believe that matching job resources are not available in the work environment; cf. <a href="#c19">Hobfoll, 2001</a>; <a href="#c20">Hobfoll &amp; Lerman, 1989</a>) or as a supplement to matching job resources (e.g., if people believe that matching job resources are not sufficiently powerful to deal with the type of job demands concerned; cf. <a href="#c19">Hobfoll, 2001</a>; <a href="#c40">Westman et al., 2005</a>). However, the extent to which people are inclined to use nonmatching job resources as a substitute for matching job resources and as a supplement to matching job resources may differ. As stated above, people who are faced with stressful work situations strive for functional homeostasis (cf. <a href="#c4">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1982</a>, <a href="#c5">1998</a>; <a href="#c14">Edwards, 1998</a>). Because functional homeostasis in stressful work situations can best be accomplished by activating matching job resources (<a href="#c36">van den Tooren, de Jonge, &amp; Dormann, 2011</a>), it is reasonable to assume that people are more inclined to use nonmatching job resources as a supplement to matching job resources than as a substitute for matching job resources.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, given the close relation between cognition and emotion (<a href="#c29">Nussbaum, 2001</a>)—emotion affects cognition and cognition underlies emotion (<a href="#c15">Folkman, Lazarus, Gruen, &amp; DeLongis, 1986</a>; <a href="#c16">Fredrickson, 2001</a>; <a href="#c18">Gray, 2004</a>; <a href="#c26">Lazarus, 1993</a>, <a href="#c27">2006</a>)—it is reasonable to assume that people who are inclined to use nonmatching job resources to deal with cognitive job demands will have a preference for emotional job resources. Similarly, we may assume that people who are inclined to activate nonmatching job resources to deal with emotional job demands will have a preference for cognitive job resources. Though both types of nonmatching job resources are less functional resources than matching job resources, they may still be a good substitute for, or supplement to, matching job resources in the demanding work situation concerned. For instance, in a cognitively demanding work situation, workers' cognitive efforts (e.g., finding solutions for complex problems) might elicit emotions (cf. <a href="#c25">Lazarus, 1991</a>) that disturb cognitive processing (cf. <a href="#c41">Zajonc, 1980</a>). In such a situation, where the regulation of cognitive job demands is impeded, emotional job resources might counteract the emotions that disturb cognitive processing, thereby better enabling workers to fulfill their cognitively demanding job. Similarly, in an emotionally demanding work situation, job-related emotions (e.g., anger or fear) might disturb cognitive processing, which, in turn, strengthens emotions or elicits new emotions that conflict organizational display rules (<a href="#c42">Zapf, 2002</a>). In that situation, cognitive job resources might preserve workers' capacity for cognitive processing and, as a result, prevent an increase of unwanted emotions. In contrast to the close relation between cognition and emotion, we have no indication of a <em>common</em> relation between physical conditions and cognition, or between physical conditions and emotion. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that people who are inclined to use nonmatching job resources to deal with physical job demands will have no preference for either cognitive or emotional job resources. Instead, they will be inclined to use them equally often. In accordance with this line of reasoning, it seems highly likely that if we ask people which specific job resources they would use to deal with cognitive, emotional, and physical job demands, respectively, the following hypotheses will apply:

<br /><em>Hypothesis 1:</em> To deal with cognitively demanding work situations, people are most inclined to use cognitive job resources, less inclined to use a combination of cognitive and emotional job resources, and even lesser inclined to use emotional job resources. People are least inclined to use physical job resources, other combinations of job resources, and no job resources at all.<br /><em>Hypothesis 2:</em> To deal with emotionally demanding work situations, people are most inclined to use emotional job resources, less inclined to use a combination of emotional and cognitive job resources, and even lesser inclined to use cognitive job resources. People are least inclined to use physical job resources, other combinations of job resources, and no job resources at all.<br /><em>Hypothesis 3:</em> To deal with physically demanding work situations, people are most inclined to use physical job resources, less inclined to use combinations of physical and cognitive job resources and physical and emotional job resources, and even lesser inclined to use cognitive job resources and emotional job resources. People are least inclined to use other combinations of job resources, and no job resources at all.</p><a id="str-19-4-311-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_19" title="METHOD">METHOD</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="str-19-4-311-ID0EDCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Design</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Data were collected by means of a vignette study.

As will be discussed in the Procedure section, we used a within-subjects experimental design in which all participants were exposed to the vignettes in random order.</p><a id="str-19-4-311-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Sample</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The study sample consisted of 92 undergraduates from a Dutch university of technology (64 males and 28 females). The mean age was 20.3 years (<em>SD</em> = 1.8). Participants had experience with jobs on the side (<em>M</em> = 4 years, <em>SD</em> = 2.7) and holiday jobs (<em>M</em> = 4 years; <em>SD</em> = 2.3).</p><a id="str-19-4-311-ID0EBCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In a laboratory environment, participants were presented 12 different hypothetical, demanding work situations (i.e., vignettes) that had been created by the researchers. The different scenarios were presented randomly to the participants on a computer screen. Each scenario represented a highly demanding work situation in a different profession. The vignettes were designed to represent a cognitively, emotionally, or physically demanding work situation. When designing the vignettes, the researchers emphasized the type of job demands concerned and avoided mentioning possible accompanying demands (or suggesting that they could be active as well). The professions in the four scenarios representing cognitive job demands were accountant, air traffic controller, journalist, and criminal judge. The professions in the four scenarios representing emotional job demands were police officer, teacher, ambulance attendant, and family guardian, and the professions in the four scenarios representing physical job demands were garbage collector, shoe salesman, cashier, and construction worker. When selecting these 12 professions, the researchers took into account the degree of ambiguity in job content. Of the chosen professions, we believed that they were primarily characterized by either cognitive, emotional, or physical job demands. The professions have been classified accordingly. Three example vignettes are presented in the <a href="#A">Appendix</a>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were asked to imagine themselves being the central figure (i.e., worker) in the vignettes who is experiencing the demanding situation concerned. After participants had read a vignette (and imagined themselves in the demanding situation), they were asked what specific type of job resources or combination of job resources they would use in that particular demanding work situation. By mouse clicking the respective button on the screen, participants could choose one of the following options: (1) “cognitive job resources,” (2) “emotional job resources,” (3) “physical job resources,” (4) “a combination of cognitive and emotional job resources,” (5) “a combination of cognitive and physical job resources,” (6) “a combination of emotional and physical job resources,” (7) “a combination of cognitive, emotional, and physical job resources,” or (8) “no job resources.” Response categories 1 through 7 have been based on the three specific types of job resources that can be distinguished: cognitive, emotional, and physical job resources. The categories were created in such a way that all possible options were covered; participants could choose either one specific job resource or a combination of specific job resources. We also included the option to choose no job resources at all (i.e., response category 8), as we wanted to make sure that people would choose particular job resources from conviction rather than simply choosing resources randomly because they had to make a choice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Before the vignettes were presented, participants were explained the concept of job resources and were given examples of cognitive, emotional, and physical job resources (e.g., the opportunity to take a mental break, a listening ear from colleagues, and ergonomic aids). Because the availability of job resources may not be equally distributed across people and is unlikely to be stable over time, different information was communicated about the presence of job resources in the demanding work situations. It was suggested that the availability of job resources was either limited or abundant. This instruction varied randomly across participants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We did not clarify the nature of the vignettes (i.e., whether a particular vignette represented a cognitive, emotional, or physical job demand). However, after the study, participants were asked to judge each of the vignettes as a cognitively, emotionally, or physically demanding job. This manipulation check revealed that the vignettes were designed properly: On average, more than 90% of the participants classified the vignettes as intended by the researchers (e.g., if a vignette was designed to represent a cognitively demanding work situation, 90% of the participants classified the vignette as such).</p><a id="str-19-4-311-ID0EACCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Data Analysis</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because the teacher scenario seemed ambiguous (about one third of the participants classified this scenario as a cognitively demanding work situation), it was decided to leave this vignette out of the analyses. For each of the 11 remaining vignettes, eight resource variables were created that represented the different resources participants could choose from (i.e., single cognitive, emotional, and physical job resources; combinations of these specific types of job resources; and no job resources). Subsequently, these resource variables were dummy coded. For instance, if a participant indicated that s/he would use single cognitive job resources in a particular vignette, the accompanying eight resource variables were, in line with the order described previously, dummy coded as 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, respectively. Similarly, if a participant had chosen a combination of cognitive and emotional job resources, the eight resource variables were dummy coded as 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0, respectively. A mean score was calculated for each resource variable over the four vignettes representing cognitive job demands (i.e., accountant, air traffic controller, journalist, and criminal judge), the three vignettes representing emotional job demands (i.e., police officer, ambulance attendant, and family guardian), and the four vignettes representing physical job demands (i.e., garbage collector, shoe salesman. cashier, and construction worker). <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> shows the means of the eight resource variables in each specific type of demanding work situation.<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/262b68d2a478380ea80a5925eb6c54c9/571cbac4/pdh/str/str-19-4-311-tbl1a.gif" alt="str-19-4-311-tbl1a.gif" title="Means and Standard Deviations of the Resource Variables" /><em>Means and Standard Deviations of the Resource Variables</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To test Hypotheses 1 through 3, we followed a conservative “top-down approach” (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).

However, to justify these three separate repeated measures MANOVAs, it was first investigated whether the extent to which participants had chosen single cognitive, emotional, and physical job resources, combinations of these specific types of job resources, and no job resources differed <em>between</em> the specific types of job demands (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, above the dotted line). For this purpose, a repeated measures MANOVA was conducted in which job resources and job demands were both specified as within-subject factors. Job resources consisted of eight levels (i.e., cognitive, emotional, physical, cognitive–emotional, cognitive–physical, emotional–physical, cognitive–emotional–physical, and no job resources) and job demands consisted of three levels (cognitive, emotional, and physical). A significant interaction effect between job resources and job demands in the multivariate test would imply that the extent to which participants had chosen single cognitive, emotional, and physical job resources, combinations of these specific types of job resources, and no job resources differed <em>between</em> the specific types of job demands (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and physical job demands).<br /><br /><a id="fig1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/ee62b43e8d5b1c04123026a6c24f4f43/571cbac4/pdh/str/str-19-4-311-fig1a.gif" alt="str-19-4-311-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

In addition, this study expanded an earlier study by <a href="#c34">van den Tooren and de Jonge (2010)</a> using an experimental design and a student sample, which can be considered additional strengths of the present study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To uncover the choices people make regarding the investment of matching and nonmatching job resources, several vignettes were developed to experimentally examine people's inclination to use single cognitive, emotional, and physical job resources, combinations of these specific types of job resources, and no job resources at all in different hypothetical demanding work situations (i.e., cognitively, emotionally, and physically demanding jobs). Data were analyzed by repeated measures MANOVAs, which partly supported Hypotheses 1 through 3. Specifically, in line with Hypothesis 1, people who were presented cognitively demanding work situations chose single cognitive job resources more often than a combination of cognitive and emotional job resources, whereas a combination of cognitive and emotional job resources was chosen more often than single emotional job resources. However, contrary to our expectations, together, these three options were not always preferred over single physical job resources, other resource combinations, and no job resources at all.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As far as Hypothesis 2 is concerned, results contradicted our predictions, as it was shown that people who were presented with emotionally demanding work situations chose single emotional job resources equally often as a combination of cognitive and emotional job resources. As expected, both single emotional job resources and a combination of cognitive and emotional job resources were chosen more often than single cognitive job resources. Contrary to our expectations, however, together, these three options were not always preferred over single physical job resources, other resource combinations, and no job resources at all.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, in line with Hypothesis 3, results revealed that if people were presented with physically demanding work situations, they chose single physical job resources more often than combinations of cognitive and physical job resources and emotional and physical job resources. However, in contrast to our predictions, a combination of cognitive and physical job resources was chosen more often than a combination of emotional and physical job resources. In addition, though people chose a combination of cognitive and physical job resources more often than single cognitive job resources and emotional job resources, a combination of emotional and physical job resources was chosen equally often as single cognitive and emotional job resources. Finally, as predicted, single cognitive and emotional job resources were chosen equally often. Nonetheless, contrary to our expectations, together, these five options were not always preferred over other resource combinations and no job resources at all.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In line with functional homeostatic regulation theory, which serves as a theoretical basis of the DISC model, the current findings suggest that the choice for matching job resources clearly prevailed. Further, it was shown that people also chose less functional nonmatching job resources, which supports the vignette study by <a href="#c34">van den Tooren and de Jonge (2010)</a>. In addition to this earlier study, however, the current study also revealed that nonmatching job resources often seemed to be chosen as a supplement to matching job resources rather than as a substitute for matching job resources. One remarkable finding was that there particularly seemed to be a dominant role for nonmatching cognitive job resources, whereas nonmatching emotional job resources were chosen less often than expected. One explanation for this finding may be that people usually operate (i.e., make decisions, take action) from a set of cognitive schemas or “frames of reference” (<a href="#c39">Vonk, 1999</a>). The specific values, beliefs, needs, and understandings that stem from these frames of reference may make people highly sensitive to detect and utilize particular “affordances” in the work environment (<a href="#c2">Baron &amp; Boudreau, 1987</a>; <a href="#c17">Gibson, 1979</a>). Affordances are properties of the work environment that can exert an influence on the person only if s/he possesses the complementary characteristic to make use of or “tune into” a certain affordance. For instance, as “helping and caring” and “giving and receiving” are valued activities among health care workers, these workers could become alert to information in the work environment suggesting emotional support. Due to their focus on affordances for emotional support, health care workers may be strongly inclined to use emotional job resources to deal with different types of high job demands. In fact, in the vignette study conducted by <a href="#c34">van den Tooren and de Jonge (2010)</a> among service workers who were mainly employed in health care, there was a dominant role for emotional job resources. Similar to service workers who may be particularly alert to sources of emotional support, in the current study, respondents' academic education at a university of technology may have made them alert to sources of knowledge and expertise. In other words, respondents may have operated from a frame of reference that led them to approach each of the vignettes in a rational manner (i.e., showing a preference for cognitive job resources). In addition, some respondents may once have learned that it is socially undesirable to show their emotions. As a result, these respondents may have been less inclined to approach the vignettes in an emotional manner (i.e., showing a preference for emotional job resources).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">From a practical point of view, we may conclude that people generally chose matching job resources, and that it is therefore worth the effort to make matching job resources available to workers after a risk diagnosis of specific job demands. However, people also seem to attach value to less functional nonmatching job resources, which they often choose in combination with matching job resources. The type of nonmatching job resources that are most likely to be chosen might be strongly related to people's frame of reference, which will, in turn, often be related to the occupational profession in which they work. For instance, whereas health care workers may be especially alert to nonmatching emotional job resources, information technology workers may be more inclined to use nonmatching cognitive job resources (cf. <a href="#c33">van de Ven, Vlerick, &amp; de Jonge, 2008</a>). Of course, sensitivity to these particular types of nonmatching job resources may differ from person to person, but in general, this might be the pattern observed.</p><a id="str-19-4-311-ID0EAACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of this study should be interpreted in terms of its limitations. First, the vignettes that were presented to participants might have caused a priming effect, so that respondents were particularly likely to focus their attention on corresponding types of job resources. However, if there had been a strong priming effect, we would have found almost perfect matches in all types of demanding situations, but we have not.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, as participants were asked to report on the use of job resources in <em>hypothetical</em> demanding work situations, it is not impossible that, in reality, they might have responded differently than they thought (and indicated) they would do. However, though assessments obtained from hypothetical situations at work may be less externally valid than assessments taken in the field, portraying a demanding job familiar to respondents has the potential to induce similar effects as those obtained in real life work settings (cf. <a href="#c3">Blodgett, Hill, &amp; Tax, 1997</a>; <a href="#c28">Levesque &amp; McDougall, 2000</a>). Of course, most respondents were not familiar with the kind of demanding situations portrayed to them in terms of “hands on” experience, but the professions presented to them are generally so well known and understandable that they should have been able to imagine themselves being the central figure (i.e., worker) in the vignettes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, participants were not asked to indicate which concrete job resource(s) they had in mind when choosing a specific job resource or combination of job resources. For instance, when participants selected the option “physical job resources,” they might had been thinking of “a trolley” or “a helping hand from colleagues.” In this case, the classification “physical job resources” is correct. However, if participants had been thinking of “a shoulder to cry on,” they should have selected the option “emotional job resources” instead. Though participants were explained the concept of job resources and were given examples of cognitive, emotional, and physical job resources, we did not actually check whether they correctly classified the concrete job resources they had in mind as cognitive, emotional, or physical job resources. If participants made classification mistakes, this might have biased our results.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, this study is based on a relatively small sample of undergraduates, which poses questions about the study's generalizability to working populations. However, because comparable patterns have been reported for a larger sample of service workers (<a href="#c34">van den Tooren &amp; de Jonge, 2010</a>), our student sample seems warranted. Moreover, it seems reasonable to assume that, like undergraduates, workers would neither have had any experience with the imaginary demanding work situations. And if they had, it would probably have been one particular scenario. From this point of view, undergraduates might be more open to different scenarios, which could enhance the study's generalizability.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To overcome some of the potential limitations of our study, it is recommended that future studies focus on real-life demanding work situations. Experienced workers may then be asked to list the concrete job resources they use in these particular work situations (e.g., a trolley or information from handbooks). Afterward, these demands and resources can be classified by a team of researchers/experts as either cognitive, emotional, or physical job demands and job resources. As the amount of demands and resources may differ over time and across occupations and jobs, quantitative measures like the (perceived) severity of job demands and the (perceived) availability of job resources may also be part of future studies. In any case, it is recommended that future studies be conducted in large, multioccupation samples.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, it is recommended that, in future studies, the theoretical basis of the DISC model (i.e., functional homeostatic regulation theory) will be further examined in terms of both its validity and its boundary conditions. With respect to the latter, it may be interesting to empirically investigate the role of workers' frame of reference, for instance, by means of a number of experiments in which participants' frame of reference is manipulated. In addition, future research may further examine the role of personal characteristics such as coping style or regulatory focus. For both characteristics, it has been hypothesized that they affect the extent to which people employ job resources (<a href="#c37">van den Tooren, de Jonge, Vlerick, Daniels, &amp; Van de Ven, 2011</a>; <a href="#c35">van den Tooren &amp; de Jonge, 2011</a>). Eventually, this type of studies may further enhance our understanding of the choices people make regarding the investment of matching and nonmatching job resources in different demanding work situations. Through these new insights, we might become better able to improve the explanatory power of job stress theories and to tailor job redesign interventions in an optimal way.</p><a id="str-19-4-311-ID0E0KB0BBAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_71" title="REFERENCES">REFERENCES</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Bakker, A.

Your main tasks are checking annual accounts, offering administrative support, and giving tax and financial advice to private individuals and companies. An entrepreneur who wants to export his product to Norway has asked you to advice him. How should he deal with the export and what may be the financial consequences? Should he open an office in Norway? And what about the sales tax when he supplies a Norwegian company? Though you have some experience with these subjects, it turns out to be a complex task that requires a lot of thinking. The client and you have agreed that you will advise him within two days. You are weighing the pros and cons, but you are unable to come up with a concrete advice. What kind(s) of job resources would you use in this situation?

It is your task to guide and support families that are faced with child rearing problems. Most of the time, children can stay at home, but sometimes—by judicial decision—it is decided to place a child in care. Yesterday, you have made such a decision. It concerns a single-parent family. The mother, who tries to raise her 7-year-old daughter by herself, has an intellectual disability. Though you are of the opinion that the mother loves her daughter and would never hurt her, she has difficulty raising her. The mother leads a very unstructured life and tends to change her day–night rhythm and that of her daughter. Moreover, meals are often missed and personal hygiene is poor. Your guidance and that of other aid organizations seems no longer adequate. Today, you have informed the mother about your decision to place her daughter in care. This message is a great blow to her and she is completely upset. Her daughter is everything to her. You feel sorry for the mother, but you have to stay professional. What kind(s) of job resources would you use in this situation?

It is two days till Christmas. Many people are already off from work and go out shopping. The evening has just begun and you have already spent an entire afternoon behind the cash desk. Due to the Christmas rush, the supermarket will be open till 10 p.m. and this evening, you will be working till closing time. You have to sit in the same posture for hours, and because there is limited space behind the cash desk, you have hardly any room to move. Moreover, the scanning of products and the handling of payments constantly require the same movement. Your back, neck, and shoulders start giving you trouble.
