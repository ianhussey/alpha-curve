Woike for helpful feedback on earlier versions of the manuscript.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Humans often show inconsistent preferences when faced with economic decisions. The endowment effect describes the bias to value things that one possesses more than things one does not possess (<a href="#c24">Thaler, 1980</a>; <a href="#c14">Kahneman, Knetsch, &amp; Thaler, 1990</a>). For example, people usually demand more money for selling a good than they would be willing to pay for acquiring the same good. Similarly, when people are endowed with one good from a pair of goods and offered to trade for the other good, they regularly refuse to trade. This bias to overvalue things in one's possession has been ascribed to peoples' general tendencies to be averse to losses (<a href="#c15">Kahneman, Knetsch, &amp; Thaler, 1991</a>) or to adhere to the status quo (<a href="#c23">Samuelson &amp; Zeckhauser, 1988</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recent research into the evolution of economic behavior suggests that humans and nonhuman primates may share some biases in decision-making like the endowment effect (<a href="#c5">Brosnan et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c17">Lakshminarayanan, Chen, &amp; Santos, 2008</a>). In addition, they also appear to share an aversion to losses (<a href="#c8">Chen, Lakshminarayanan, &amp; Santos, 2006</a>). Importantly, however, while the endowment effect in humans is evident across a wide range of commodities (e.g., coffee mugs and chocolate: <a href="#c16">Knetsch, 1989</a>; time: <a href="#c13">Hoorens, Remmers, &amp; van de Riet, 1999</a>; basketball tickets: <a href="#c7">Carmon &amp; Ariely, 2000</a>; lottery tickets: <a href="#c1">Bar-Hillel &amp; Neter, 1996</a>) and seems to emerge in early childhood (<a href="#c11">Harbaugh, Krause, &amp; Vesterlund, 2000</a>), this effect has only been demonstrated to a very limited extent in nonhuman primates. Specifically, when capuchin monkeys (<em>Cebus apella</em>) and chimpanzees (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>) were endowed with different food items and offered to trade for items of equal value, they preferred to keep the food in their possession (<a href="#c5">Brosnan et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c17">Lakshminarayanan et al., 2008</a>). However, chimpanzees did not prefer to keep nonfood items (i.e., toys) they were endowed with (<a href="#c5">Brosnan et al., 2007</a>), indicating that endowment effects in nonhuman primates may be limited to food endowment. It thus remains unclear whether endowment effects in nonhuman primates really compare to the commodity-general effects found in humans. To date, previous studies have inadequately explored the scope of endowment effects in nonhuman primates either because they endowed nonhuman primates only with food (e.g., <a href="#c17">Lakshminarayanan et al., 2008</a>) or because they used objects that were of very limited value to nonhuman primates (e.g., toys, <a href="#c5">Brosnan et al., 2007</a>). In addition, studies on endowment effects in primates so far have focused their investigation on one primate species at the time (chimpanzees or capuchin monkeys), but did not explore these effects across different species.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Here we present the first study to investigate endowment effects in all four great ape species (bonobos [<em>Pan paniscus</em>], chimpanzees [<em>Pan troglodytes</em>], gorillas [<em>Gorilla gorilla</em>], and orangutans [P<em>ongo pygmaeus</em>]) comparing food and nonfood objects of instrumental value; that is, tools that were used to retrieve food. As the previously established absence of endowment effects for toys may have been due to chimpanzee's lack of interest in objects that are not associated with food rewards, we wanted to ensure that all endowment objects (i.e., food items and tools) resulted in obtaining a food reward. In principle, all four ape species have been observed to use tools for food retrieval either in the wild or in the laboratory, though their propensity for manufacturing and using tools varies (<a href="#c25">Tomasello &amp; Call, 1997</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For our experiments we adapted the procedure of <a href="#c5">Brosnan and colleagues (2007)</a>. In the beginning, we established that apes would principally be willing to trade food and tools in their possession. Next, apes were given a choice between items of a pair (i.e., between two different food items or between two different tools) to determine which of the two items they preferred. We then endowed them with one item of the pair and tested their willingness to trade for the other item and vice versa. Similar to <a href="#c5">Brosnan et al. (2007)</a>, we also included trials where apes were offered to trade for an item that was identical to the one they had been endowed with. This was to test whether apes may have had a preference for interacting with the experimenter over a preference for keeping items in their possession. In Experiment 1 (food endowment), we endowed apes with two different, highly favored food items (a banana slice and a food pellet). In order to facilitate trading of the food items, consumption of food was delayed by placing all items in transparent plastic tubes. In Experiment 2 (tool endowment), we endowed apes with two different sticks that could be used to retrieve a food reward on a platform. Half of the apes were first tested in Experiment 1, and half were first tested in Experiment 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Experiment 3, we investigated food endowment effects further. First, we wanted to explore whether endowment effects would be attenuated by the amount of food apes were endowed with. We hypothesized that apes would trade more frequently when they were endowed with multiple food items (e.g., 12 identical items). Second, this design also allowed us to compare food endowment effects in different great ape species with sufficient statistical power, which we could not have achieved using the procedure of <a href="#c5">Brosnan et al. (2007)</a> due to the small sample sizes available to us. We decided to focus our investigation on bonobos and orangutans as they represent one of the most closely and the most distantly related ape species to humans, respectively (e.g., <a href="#c10">Enard &amp; Pääbo, 2004</a>). In Experiment 3, we thus endowed bonobos and orangutans with either 1 or 12 food items of the same kind (e.g., 12 grapes) and offered to trade them for 1 or 12 food items of a different kind (e.g., 12 dried plums).</p><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0EDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Experiment 1">Experiment 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0ECDCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Subjects</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Twenty-two great apes (5 bonobos [<em>Pan paniscus</em>], 12 chimpanzees [<em>Pan troglodytes</em>], 2 gorillas [<em>Gorilla gorilla</em>], 3 orangutans [P<em>ongo pygmaeus</em>]) participated in this experiment (see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> for details).

All apes were housed at the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center in Leipzig, where they had access to sleeping rooms, and seminatural indoor and outdoor enclosures. They were fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, occasionally supplemented by meat, eggs, and yoghurt, and had ad libitum access to water. Subjects were neither food nor water deprived.

In the choice trial, apes were first shown both food tubes. Then, one food tube was placed on the left-hand side of a platform in front of the ape and the other tube was placed on the right-hand side of the same platform. We counterbalanced across apes whether the banana-tube was presented on the left-hand side or the right-hand side of the platform. Apes could indicate their choice by pointing to one of the food tubes. Only first points were scored and the respective food tube handed over to the ape. Next, apes participated in two trading-control trials where we tested whether they would be in principle willing to trade food items in their possession for the endowment food. Only apes that passed the trading-control trials participated in the subsequent endowment trials. We endowed apes with a piece of carrot in a plastic tube, as a piece of carrot is usually a less attractive food item for apes than a slice of banana or a pellet. In one of the trials, apes were offered to trade for a banana-tube and in the other trial they were offered to trade for a pellet-tube. The order of these trials was counterbalanced across apes. Each trade took place in the following way: we first showed the ape a banana-/pellet-tube and a carrot-tube. We then gave the carrot-tube to the ape. To elicit a trade we held the banana-/pellet-tube in one hand and started to gesture with the other, empty hand (that is, stretching out the hand and saying the ape's name and/or saying “Lass uns tauschen!” [“Let's trade!”]). However, trades only took place when the food in the tube that was in the apes' possession was left intact. If apes started to eat the food in the tubes, their behavior was scored as a nontrade. Apes that did not trade the carrot tubes for a banana- and a pellet-tube did not participate in the endowment trials to ensure that only those individuals participated that would be in principle willing to trade food items.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On days two to five, each ape experienced two endowment trials and two control trials with identical food items.

In endowment trials, apes were endowed with a banana-tube and offered a trade for a pellet-tube (Trial 1) and vice versa (Trial 2). Trades occurred in the same manner as described above. In control trials, they were endowed with a banana-/pellet-tube and offered a trade for an identical banana-/pellet-tube (Trials 3 and 4). At the end of each endowment and control trial we asked apes to return the empty food tube, but did not offer a reward in return. This was to test whether apes were in principle willing to give up objects in their possession, particularly if these objects were of little value or use to them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, on day six, we repeated the two trading-control trials from day one by endowing apes with a carrot-tube and offering them a trade for a banana-/pellet-tube.

However, when endowed with a banana slice, individuals of all four ape species—except orangutans—preferred to keep the banana-slice and did not trade it for a pellet. Similarly, when they were endowed with a pellet, individuals from all four species preferred to keep the pellet and refused to trade it for a banana slice. Combining the data from all four species, we compared the number of apes that chose a banana slice or a pellet in the choice trial to the number of apes that chose to keep the respective food item in the endowment trials. We found that 18% of apes chose a banana slice; however, when they were endowed with a banana slice and offered a trade for a pellet, significantly more apes (64%) preferred to keep the banana slice, <em>p</em> = .006 (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2A</a>). Similarly, 82% of apes chose the pellet, but even more apes (95%) chose to keep the pellet when they were endowed with it, <em>p</em> = .25. In the control trials, where apes were offered a trade for an identical item, 86% of apes kept the banana slice and the pellet, respectively. When we compared the trading behavior of individuals in the control trials (i.e., whether individuals chose to keep or to trade the endowed food item for an identical one) to their trading behavior in the endowment trials, we found no significant difference—neither for banana slices, <em>p</em> = .18, nor for pellets, <em>p</em> = .50. On an individual level, 59% of apes never traded any of the endowed food items in endowment trials, 36% of apes kept possession of their preferred item, 5% of apes (i.e., one ape) kept the nonpreferred item, and no apes traded both items (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2B</a>).<br /><br /><a id="tbl2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/c267260129437ed60eca73a492304108/571c876e/pdh/com/com-125-4-436-tbl2a.gif" alt="com-125-4-436-tbl2a.gif" title="Species' Preferences for Choosing or Keeping Items in Choice and Endowment Trials in Experiments 1 and 2" /><em>Species' Preferences for Choosing or Keeping Items in Choice and Endowment Trials in Experiments 1 and 2</em></span><br /><br /><a id="fig2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/ec16fc44fbdafae63c0725ff46fccb0f/571c876e/pdh/com/com-125-4-436-fig2a.gif" alt="com-125-4-436-fig2a.gif" title="Figure 2.

Looking at individual preferences, only two apes (9%) reversed their food preferences at the end of the experiment, <em>p</em> = .50. One chimpanzee (Robert) switched from preferring pellets to preferring banana slices, while the reverse was true for one bonobo (Joey). All other apes either had the same preference as before or showed no preference (i.e., chose banana slices and pellets equally often in the four choice trials). Moreover, apes returned empty food tubes on average 96% (±5.6%) of the time after endowment and control trials without receiving any reward in return. While at the beginning of the experiment 100% of apes traded a piece of carrot for food that was used in the endowment trials, significantly fewer apes traded a piece of carrot for a banana slice (59%), <em>p</em> = .004, and for a pellet (64%), <em>p</em> = .008, respectively, after participation in the endowment and control trials.</p><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0EADCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Discussion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Experiment 1, we found that apes were reluctant to trade banana slices and pellets once they had come to possess them. Qualitatively, this effect was present across all four ape species with the exception of orangutans, who had a very strong preference for pellets and preferred to trade banana slices for pellets. While this effect was significant for banana slices across species, it was nonsignificant for pellets. However, since the majority of apes chose pellets in the choice trial, the difference between the choice and the endowment trials could not have reached significance even if all apes had kept their pellets. In fact, all apes but one kept pellets when offered to trade for banana slices. Furthermore, focusing on the individual level, more than half the apes never traded any of the food items they were endowed with. These findings indicate that endowment effects for food are prevalent across different great ape species on the level of the group as well as on the level of the individual. Although we did not find endowment effects in orangutans, this may have been due to methodological limitations and in particular the very small sample size. We return to this issue again later in Experiment 3, where we conducted a direct comparison of food endowment effects in orangutans and bonobos.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Control trials revealed that apes preferred to keep food in their possession even when offered to trade for identical food items. The fact that trading rates between endowment and control trials did not differ indicates that apes may have focused primarily on keeping highly valued food in their possession—irrespective of the alternative food they were offered. Moreover, at the end of the experiment, about 40% of the apes refused to trade pieces of carrot for endowment food. It is possible that some apes developed a general reluctance for trading food in their possession while participating in the endowment and control trials, which then may have carried-over to food items that they were initially willing to trade. Alternatively, some apes may have perceived trading of food as increasingly risky as time went by and thus preferred to keep food in their possession, disregarding the alternative food on offer. Their reluctance to trade food items in their possession, however, cannot be attributed to a general reluctance to hand over possessions: Apes traded pieces of carrot for endowment food at the beginning of the study and, in addition, regularly returned empty food tubes after endowment and control trials. This indicates that they were in principle prone to trading items in their possession.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To further investigate whether apes would show endowment effects across a range of different commodities, we conducted a second experiment, where we endowed apes with tools that were instrumental in retrieving food.</p><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0ECCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_40" title="Experiment 2">Experiment 2</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0ECCCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Subjects</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Twenty-three apes (3 bonobos [<em>Pan paniscus</em>], 13 chimpanzees [<em>Pan troglodytes</em>], 2 gorillas [<em>Gorilla gorilla</em>], 5 orangutans [P<em>ongo pygmaeus</em>]) participated in Experiment 2 (see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> for details).

We used two functional tools (a wooden stick and a black plastic stick, each 40-cm long), that were long enough to reach the grape-half on the platform (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1B</a>). We also used one nonfunctional tool (a blue wooden stick, 15-cm long), that was too short to complete the task (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1B</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On day one, apes participated in familiarization trials, one choice trial, and two trading-control trials. Apes were familiarized with the task by presenting one of the functional tools, the nonfunctional tool, and half a grape on a platform for up to six times. One tool was placed on the left-hand side of the platform and the other tool on the right-hand side of a platform in front of the ape. We counterbalanced across apes whether the plastic tools was presented on the left-hand side or the right-hand side of the platform. Next, we placed half a grape in the middle of the platform at equidistance from the two tools. Apes could indicate their choice by pointing to one of the tools. Only the first pointing instance was scored and the respective tool was given to the ape. The ape could then use that tool to retrieve the half grape. As only one of the functional tools was presented per trial, the order of presenting the two tools was alternated for up to six trials. Apes only participated in the experiment if they chose the functional tool in two successive trials and retrieved the food successfully. After familiarization with the task, apes experienced one choice trial, where we gave them a choice between the two functional tools. In the choice trial, one functional tool was placed on the left-hand side of the platform and the other functional tool was placed on the right-hand side. Then, a grape was placed in the middle of the platform and apes could indicate which tool they wanted to use by pointing to the respective tool. The choice trial was conducted to assess which of the two functional tools they preferred. Finally, apes participated in two trading-control trials where we tested their willingness to trade the nonfunctional tool for a functional one. In one of the trials, apes were given the nonfunctional tool and offered a trade for the plastic tool. In the other trial, they were offered a trade of the nonfunctional tool for the wooden tool. The order of trading-control trials was counterbalanced across apes. Only apes that passed both trading-control trials participated in the study. Trades were similar to Experiment 1 with the following exceptions: Apes were first shown the two tools, then given the nonfunctional tool and offered a trade for the functional tool. However, apes had to trade tools within 15 seconds, during which no food was available on the platform. This delay was introduced because a pilot experiment had revealed that apes would not attend to the experimenter if food became available immediately. After 15 seconds—irrespective of whether apes had traded or not—a half grape was put on the platform.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On days two to five, each ape experienced two endowment trials and two control trials with identical tools.

Similarly, chimpanzees and orangutans (but less so bonobos and gorillas) preferred to trade the wooden tool for the plastic tool. Combining the data from all four species, we compared the number of apes that chose the plastic or the wooden tool in the choice trial to the number of apes that chose to keep the respective tools in the endowment trials. We found that 70% of apes chose the plastic tool (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>); however, when apes were endowed with the plastic tool and offered to trade for the wooden tool, significantly fewer apes (17%) kept the plastic tool, <em>p</em> = .002.

Qualitatively, this effect was most pronounced in orangutans and chimpanzees. A comparison between apes' trading behavior in the current experiment and in Experiment 1 revealed that apes were more likely to trade tools than to trade food. Thus, in contrast to Experiment 1, apes did not show any endowment effects when they were endowed with tools. In fact, the majority of apes traded tools in both endowment trials, and most apes also traded endowed tools for identical ones in the control trials. Moreover, at the end of the experiment, the majority of apes even traded the functional tools for a nonfunctional tool, thereby forgoing the possibility to retrieve the food reward. Apes may thus have preferred trading tools with the experimenter to keeping those tools in their possession. Alternatively, they may have felt that they were supposed to hand over nonfood items to the experimenter. The overall finding, however, that apes were very willing to give up nonfood items—even if they were instrumental in accessing food—suggests that endowment effects in apes may be limited to food endowment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In a third experiment we thus wanted to explore food endowment effects in apes further. We were particularly interested in investigating whether apes' trading behavior would be affected by the amount of food they were endowed with. We hypothesized that apes would be more willing to trade food if they had multiple items in their possession. In addition, we wanted to revisit the lack of endowment effects in orangutans observed in Experiment 1 and use a methodology that would allow us to draw direct comparisons between different great ape species with sufficient statistical power. We decided to compare orangutans to bonobos to be able to study whether endowment effects may be influenced by differences in phylogenetic relatedness to humans.</p><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0EBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_67" title="Experiment 3">Experiment 3</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0ECBCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Subjects</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nine apes (4 bonobos [<em>Pan paniscus</em>], 5 orangutans [P<em>ongo pygmaeus</em>]) participated in Experiment 3, all of which had participated in the previous two experiments (see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> for details).

We used half a peanut shell (containing one peanut), half a dried apricot, half a dried plum, and half a grape for the preference test.

In 1-endowment trials, they were endowed with 1 grape-tube and allowed to trade for 1 plum-tube (Trial 1) and vice versa (Trial 2). In 12-endowment trials, they were endowed with 12 grape-tubes and allowed to trade for 12 plum-tubes (Trial 3) and vice versa (Trial 4). In each endowment trial—before apes were given access to the testing room—we first lined up the endowment tubes (i.e., the tubes apes were endowed with) in the apes' room. We then lined up the other tubes (i.e., the tubes that were offered for trade) on a platform exactly opposite the endowment tubes outside the testing room. The apes were then given access to the room.

While at the beginning of the experiment 100% of apes traded a piece of carrot for food that was used in the endowment trials, fewer apes traded a piece of carrot for a grape (56%), <em>p</em> = .13, and for a plum (44%), <em>p</em> = .06, respectively, after participation in the endowment trials.</p><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0EABCAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Discussion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Experiment 3, orangutans and bonobos were reluctant to trade food in their possession independent of whether they were endowed with one or 12 identical food items. Moreover, we did not find any difference in endowment effects between bonobos and orangutans. This finding extends the results from Experiment 1 and indicates that endowment effects are present across all four great ape species. In addition, apes did not trade more frequently when endowed with more food items, indicating that the amount of endowed food (1 item vs. 12 items) did not have an influence on food endowment effects. Previously, a similar result was obtained for two groups of chimpanzees, where individuals were reluctant to trade food items in their possession for food of similar value after they had been endowed with 30 identical food items (<a href="#c4">Brosnan, Grady, Lambeth, Schapiro, &amp; Beran, 2008</a>). However, in addition to extending these findings to two other great ape species, namely bonobos and orangutans, we could also demonstrate that the number of endowed items did not play a significant role in influencing trading behavior.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Similarly to Experiment 1, apes returned empty food tubes on the majority of trials, indicating that reluctance to principally hand over items could not explain endowment effects for food. In addition, apes were again more reluctant to trade pieces of carrot for endowment food after participation in the endowment trials—though this effect was not significant, possibly due to the small number of individuals in this experiment. This decline in trading rates at the end of the experiment could indicate that for some apes endowment effects may have carried over to food that they were initially willing to trade with the experimenter. Alternatively, over time some apes may have perceived trades as increasingly risky and thus preferred to keep food in their possession irrespective of the food's value. However, previous studies investigating trading behavior in chimpanzees have found that chimpanzees can flexibly adapt their trading behavior depending on the value of the food involved in the exchanges (e.g., <a href="#c18">Lefebvre, 1982</a>; <a href="#c19">Lefebvre &amp; Hewitt, 1986</a>). The decline in trading rates that we observed in our study thus remains puzzling, and further investigations into how great apes' trading behavior for food changes over time may be needed to shed more light on these findings.</p><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0EACAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_94" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In our study, apes from all four great ape species preferred to keep food in their possession once they were endowed with it. While previous studies have only demonstrated endowment effects for chimpanzees (<a href="#c5">Brosnan et al., 2007</a>) and capuchin monkeys (<a href="#c17">Lakshminarayanan et al., 2008</a>), our study showed that these effects extend to all four great ape species. In addition, we could demonstrate that food endowment is not affected by the number of food items apes were endowed with. These endowment effects could not be attributed to the apes being, in principle, reluctant to trade items, because apes reliably returned empty food tubes at the end of each trial without receiving a reward. However, apes did not show endowment effects for tools even though they were later used to retrieve food. In contrast to their performance in Experiments 1 and 3, apes tested in Experiment 2 frequently traded tools after being endowed with them. In fact, they traded tools more often than food, which indicates that apes treated the two commodities <em>food</em> and <em>tool</em> very differently.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In line with previous research, our findings suggest that endowment effects in all four great ape species (and other nonhuman primates) are genuinely limited to food endowment (<a href="#c5">Brosnan et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c17">Lakshminarayanan et al., 2008</a>). The absence of an endowment effect for functional tools could be a result of the transitory nature of material possessions in nonhuman primates and the absence of any kind of (socially reinforced) ownership (<a href="#c21">Pryor, 2003</a>). As a consequence, nonhuman primates may not value material possessions as humans typically do.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Alternatively, apes may have experienced trading tools as a low-cost and rewarding activity in itself. Throughout the study, apes were very prone to exchanging nonfood objects with human experimenters. For example, the majority of apes in Experiments 1 and 3 returned empty food tubes without receiving any reward in return. Apes were also very likely to trade tools for identical tools (while they showed the opposite behavior with regards to food). Furthermore, at the end of Experiment 2—despite having repeatedly experienced the contingencies of the set-up—the majority of apes traded functional tools for nonfunctional tools, thus forgoing the possibility of retrieving a food reward. Apes thus even paid short-term costs due to their disposition for trading nonfood objects. It is conceivable that apes valued exchange of nonfood items with the experimenter more than keeping those items in their possession.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Furthermore, differences between food and tool endowment could have been due to the presence or absence of food rewards. Even though tools were instrumental in retrieving food, no food was present during tool trades. Recent findings with human subjects suggest that the physical presence of a good influences people's valuation of that good. For example, people were willing to pay more for food when it was physically present than when they only read a description or saw an image of the food (<a href="#c6">Bushong, King, Camerer, &amp; Rangel, 2010</a>). Similarly, apes could have valued tools less than food because tools were only indicative of the presence of food. Under this view, the pattern of performance we observed—with apes showing an endowment effect for foods and not tools—may reflect differences in the salience of the reward across the two stimulus types.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, food endowment effects in nonhuman primates may be caused by a different underlying process than endowment effects in humans. While endowment effects in humans are usually attributed to loss aversion (<a href="#c15">Kahneman et al., 1991</a>), apes may simply find it difficult to inhibit the consumption of food in their possession. Past research has demonstrated that great apes can forgo immediate rewards for future rewards under certain conditions: if they are offered a more preferred reward (chimpanzees: <a href="#c3">Beran, Savage-Rumbaugh, Pate, &amp; Rumbaugh, 1999</a>), if food accumulates over time (chimpanzees and orangutans: <a href="#c2">Beran, 2002</a>), if they are offered a larger piece of reward (chimpanzees: <a href="#c9">Dufour, Pelé, Sterck, &amp; Thierry, 2007</a>), or if they are offered a larger quantity of food (bonobos and chimpanzees: <a href="#c22">Rosati, Stevens, Hare, &amp; Hauser, 2007</a>). However, all of these studies have in common that the quantity (or the value) of the future food reward was higher than the value of the immediate reward. In contrast, it is inherent to endowment studies to use rewards that are very close in perceived value and quantity, which may constitute the crucial difference between tests of delay of gratification and tests of endowment effects. Indeed, <a href="#c17">Lakshminarayanan and colleagues (2008)</a> found that capuchin monkeys showed no evidence of an endowment effect for food rewards when the food being offered was of higher quality (see Experiment 2). Likewise, apes in our study initially traded pieces of carrot for the more attractive endowment food and only stopped trading once both food items were similarly attractive (though for some individuals this effect carried over to trades at the end of the experiment where they were endowed with carrots and offered to trade for the endowment food). Future studies could investigate this issue further by substituting food items for tokens that represent the respective food. If apes were to show no endowment effects for tokens (i.e., when food is no longer directly present) than this would provide evidence that food endowment effects in apes may be driven by a lack of inhibition to consume possessed food. This lack of inhibition could also explain why we did not find endowment effects for tools, as food was not directly present during tool trades.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While humans show endowment effects across a wide range of different commodities (e.g., <a href="#c16">Knetsch, 1989</a>; <a href="#c7">Carmon &amp; Ariely, 2000</a>), endowment effects in apes appear to be limited to endowment with food. This suggests that endowment effects in nonhuman primates may not really be comparable to the more generalized endowment effects found in humans. In addition, there is recent evidence that apes value the commodity food much more than humans (<a href="#c22">Rosati et al., 2007</a>). Hence it is unclear whether humans would even show endowment effects for food determined for immediate consumption.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In our three experiments, we tested individuals from all four great ape species (bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans). Qualitatively, in Experiment 1, endowment effects seemed strongest in bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas, whereas in Experiment 2 chimpanzees and orangutans were most prone to trading tools. Species differences were difficult to assess, however, due to the small number of individuals in all species apart from chimpanzees. Yet, in Experiment 3 we directly compared endowment effects for food in orangutans and bonobos, which represent humans' closest and most distant great ape relatives, respectively (e.g., <a href="#c10">Enard &amp; Pääbo, 2004</a>). We found no species difference, which indicates that endowment effects for food are present across the entire great ape lineage. In addition, evidence from studies with capuchin monkeys (<a href="#c17">Lakshminarayanan et al., 2008</a>) suggests that these effects may even be shared with more distantly related primates. Even though recent studies on risk preferences have revealed that chimpanzees are more risk prone than bonobos (<a href="#c12">Heilbronner, Rosati, Stevens, &amp; Hare, 2008</a>), our study found no differences in endowment effects for food. One possible explanation for the different findings could be that trades in endowment situations are associated with less risk and thus may not tap into the same mechanisms responsible for creating divergent risk preferences in chimpanzees and bonobos for risky choices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In conclusion, we replicated the endowment effect on food by chimpanzees and extended these findings to all other great ape species. However, we were unable to elicit endowment effects with objects instrumental in retrieving food. Our results therefore suggest that a spontaneous overvaluation of nonconsumable possessions may be a uniquely human quality not shared with other nonhuman primates.</p><a id="com-125-4-436-ID0EYABAA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_105" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Bar-Hillel, M., &amp; Neter, E.
